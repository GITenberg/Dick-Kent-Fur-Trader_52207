<h1 title="">DICK KENT, FUR TRADER</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">BLIND MAN&rsquo;S PASS</span></h2>
<p>Dick Kent, bronzed by exposure to wind and
sun, leaned over the rough pine table in the trading
room of Factor MacClaren at Fort Good Faith and
listened intently to the conversation being carried on
at that particular moment between Murky Nichols,
prospector and gentleman of parts, and Corporal
Rand of the Mackenzie River detachment of the
Royal North West Mounted Police. On the paper
in front of them, torn from a convenient packing
case, were a number of irregular lines, dots and
scrawls, which had been placed there with the aid of
the stub of a lead pencil, held awkwardly in the
hands of the big prospector.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show yuh,&rdquo; Nichols explained eagerly,
&ldquo;jus&rsquo; where I think ol&rsquo; Daddy McInnes crossed the
Dominion Range. He travelled east an&rsquo; then south
until he got to Placer Lake, goin&rsquo; through what the
Indians call Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass. There ain&rsquo;t no other
way he could o&rsquo; got through, sick an&rsquo; worn out like
he was. That pass must come out on this side of
the range somewhere near where yuh picked up his
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand drummed softly on the table and
regarded Murky&rsquo;s animated face with thoughtful
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds reasonable,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;In fact,
that&rsquo;s exactly the way I had it figured out myself.
Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass must be something more than a
myth&mdash;a mere Indian legend. McInnes got through
some way, travelling along a fairly well defined, not
too difficult trail. No man can walk over Dominion
Range, neither can he crawl under it. Yet McInnes
came through. I have conclusive proof of that.
But where is Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there somewhere,&rdquo; Nichols declared doggedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I agree with you, Murky.&rdquo; The
mounted policeman took the pencil from the prospector&rsquo;s
hand and drew a straight line near the center
of the map. &ldquo;This line,&rdquo; he pointed out&mdash;Dick
thought a little impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;represents a distance
of thirty miles. The country is rough, broken,
almost inaccessible along its entire length. Somewhere
within that thirty miles is a narrow opening,
probably not more than fifty, a hundred or two hundred
feet wide, which forms one end of what is
called Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass. Now how are you going
to find it? There are a thousand different openings,
all more or less alike. Attempt to follow any one of
them, and you end up against a solid rock wall.
You go back and start all over again somewhere else&mdash;and
with the same result. I spent two weeks out
there, going through the same stupid performance
day after day. Only infinite patience or fool&rsquo;s luck
will lead you to the right opening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So interested had Dick Kent become that presently
he crowded closer to the two men and began staring
at the paper himself. Exactly what were they trying
to do? What were they talking about? Who was
McInnes, and why all this bother about a fabled trail
through the mountains no one seemed to know anything
about? He was interrupted in his train of
thought by the next statement of the mounted policeman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;McInnes had been dead more than a week when
I found him. You could see the poor devil had
been half-starved and had suffered every sort of
hardship and privation. How he had managed to
stagger along with that heavy load is more than I
can imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad ol&rsquo; Daddy has passed,&rdquo; Murky sighed
regretfully. &ldquo;I &rsquo;member seeing him one time &rsquo;bout
three years ago over in the Goose Lake country.
Might&rsquo; fine ol&rsquo; man he was, an&rsquo; a good trapper, folks
said. Never failed to bring in a good catch ever&rsquo;
spring&mdash;mostly fox, marten an&rsquo; beaver&mdash;an&rsquo; he got
top prices &rsquo;cause he knew how to cure his fur&mdash;all
prime, A-Number-1 stuff it was. He had a knack,
almost amountin&rsquo; to genius for locatin&rsquo; black and
cross fox an&rsquo; then gettin&rsquo; &rsquo;em to walk plump into his
traps.&rdquo; Nichols paused to gaze reminiscently out of
the window and to smile to himself. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t beat
him that particular way, no, sir. A big catch ever&rsquo;
year&mdash;fortune for most men; yet Daddy allers complained
that he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; atall, that he
was either gonna quit or cross the Dominion Range,
where trappin&rsquo; was a hull lot better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about the black fox skins,&rdquo; remarked
Corporal Rand, pushing the paper aside.
&ldquo;In the pack I found beside the body, there were
eight of the shiniest, loveliest black pelts I&rsquo;ve ever
looked upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he came through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass,&rdquo; mused
Murky. &ldquo;The clever ol&rsquo; coot. Too bad he didn&rsquo;t
live to tell about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had edged still closer. His eyes were shining
with interest. He reached over and touched the
sleeve of the corporal&rsquo;s scarlet tunic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Corporal Rand&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve been eavesdropping.
You don&rsquo;t mind, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mounted policeman turned quickly and smiled
into the eager face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, you&rsquo;re welcome to any information
or nonsense you may have heard. Isn&rsquo;t that the
truth, Murky?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask you a question?&rdquo; Dick persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A reality or a legend&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure which. Outside
of Daddy McInnes I&rsquo;d say it was a legend. We
used to laugh at the old tales about it. The Indians
claimed that years and years ago one of their ancestors
had discovered a long, narrow pass or defile that
cut Dominion range somewhere due west of here.
In 1895 a party of mounted police explorers investigated
the story by making a very careful, painstaking
search through all the country lying between Cauldron
Lake and Summit River. Nothing came of it.
The party decided that the tale was a myth. Blind
Man&rsquo;s Pass was, until a few weeks ago, a bye-word
among all the white men living in this section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand paused and favored Dick with a
most engaging smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Daddy McInnes?&rdquo; the young
man inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the bald facts and you can draw your
own conclusions. A little over a year ago Daddy
McInnes left us. For years it had been his ambition
to trap on the other side of the Dominion Range in
what is commonly known as the Caribou Hills country.
As the crow flies, Caribou Hills are less than
three hundred miles away. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been
much of a journey if McInnes could have gone
straight there, crossing the mountains. But, of
course, he couldn&rsquo;t. He chose instead the more sensible
and longer route by way of the Yellowhead
Pass, which, as you know, is many hundred miles
south of here. It took Daddy the greater part of
one summer to make the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand rose slowly to his feet and walked
over to a window, gazing somberly out across a
bleak, snow-streaked meadow that extended west and
north to meet the encroaching woodland. He swung
about presently, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Daddy came back. What motive prompted
him, I have no way of finding out. All I know is
that he did come back&mdash;but not by the Yellowhead
route! I came upon his dead body less than a week
ago. It was lying in a sheltered spot near a little
knoll, less than a hundred yards from the banks of
Run River. It was easy to determine the cause of
his death. He died of starvation and exposure.
McInnes is an old, old man and this last trip had
proved too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think that he had contrived somehow
to cross over the range?&rdquo; queried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, utterly impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t come by the Yellowhead route, or
cross the mountains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only possible solution is Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass,&rdquo;
interrupted Corporal Rand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet. But I have every hope that we will
in a very short time. The best scout and woodsman
who ever enlisted in a service of the R. N. W. M. P.
is out there now looking for it&mdash;a man called Malemute
Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malemute Slade!&rdquo; shouted Dick, clapping his
hands in glee. &ldquo;Why, corporal, I know him. He&rsquo;s
a friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that. I knew that Slade was
well acquainted with Factor MacClaren&rsquo;s nephew,
Sandy. Are you by any chance the Dick Kent, who
accompanied Sandy last summer to Thunder River
in search of a gold mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dick.</p>
<p>Corporal Rand laughed as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that we&rsquo;ll shake on that. The mounted
police haven&rsquo;t forgotten the incident. Time and time
again, before a crackling fire, when we happened to
meet on patrol, Sergeant Richardson entertained me
with the history of your exploits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a lot of trouble with the Henderson
gang,&rdquo; stated Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard. Fortunately they&rsquo;re wiped out.
They were the worst band of outlaws that ever infested
the North. By the way, what ever became of
that young Indian lad, Toma, who used to accompany
you on so many of your expeditions?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out with Sandy right now on a hunting
trip,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting them back today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murky Nichols rose lazily, yawned, and stretched
himself to his full length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll toddle along,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Hope yuh find that pass, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a friendly nod to Dick in passing, Nichols
strode over to the counter before which a small group
of half-breed men, women and children chatted
volubly.</p>
<p>No sooner had the prospector passed out of hearing,
than Rand turned eagerly to Dick:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever meet Murky before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick in surprise, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve heard
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer character,&rdquo; mused Rand, half to himself.
&ldquo;Sometimes bears watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Dick, a little startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murky&rsquo;s intentions are the best in the world, but
his sense of right and wrong is considerably clouded.
Also, you may or may not have heard, Nichols has
the reputation of being the laziest mortal on earth
and one of the shrewdest. He has money but seldom
works. For months past I&rsquo;ve been trying to
find the key that will open the secret to Murky&rsquo;s
checkered past.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Slightly annoyed at Rand&rsquo;s garrulity, Dick looked
up sharply. Well he knew that no self-respecting
member of the force became so confidential in so
short a time with a comparative stranger. For the
most part, the men of the Royal Mounted were reserved,
dignified and aloof. It was none of Dick&rsquo;s
business what sort of a man Murky was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bothers me,&rdquo; Corporal Rand hastened on,
&ldquo;is why Nichols should be so interested in Blind
Man&rsquo;s Pass. This is the third time he&rsquo;s troubled
himself to seek me out and pester me with questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an interesting topic,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know as I blame him very much. Don&rsquo;t forget, corporal,
that I&rsquo;ve just been bothering you with questions
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve known Nichols longer than you&rsquo;ve known
me,&rdquo; Dick shot back, somewhat testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dick,&rdquo; grinned the corporal, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept
your reprimand. And, come to think of it, I&rsquo;ve
got a note for you. It may possibly explain why I
do not hesitate about taking you into my confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A note!&rdquo; gasped Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s self-explanatory.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Dick received the missive and opened it, considerably
perplexed. He read quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Richard:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be very grateful to you for any assistance
you may be able to render to the bearer of this
note, Corporal William Rand, of the Mackenzie
River detachment. Corporal Rand will instruct
you in certain matters of extreme importance.
Please trust him implicitly in everything.</p>
<p>Please convey my very best wishes to Mr.
MacClaren and your two young cronies, Sandy
and Toma.</p>
<p><span class="center">Sincerely,</span>
<span class="jr">Henry C. Richardson,</span>
<span class="jr">Sergeant R. N. W. M. P.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Dick had finished reading the letter, he
looked across at Corporal Rand with new understanding
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help, of course. There isn&rsquo;t anything I
wouldn&rsquo;t do for Sergeant Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mounted policeman moved closer and spoke in
a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down at that table and pick up that old magazine.
Pretend you&rsquo;re reading. Watch Nichols. In
ten or fifteen minutes two half breeds will enter this
room and will probably walk over and engage Murky
in conversation. You won&rsquo;t be able to hear a thing
they say, but I want you to notice particularly
whether or not any money passes between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had scarcely recovered from his astonishment,
when Corporal Rand turned with quick, military
precision and walked swiftly out of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">DICK PLAYS THE PART OF A SPY</span></h2>
<p>The two men who entered the trading room within
a few minutes after Corporal Rand&rsquo;s sudden exit
were undoubtedly half-breeds. Both were heavy,
powerful-looking specimens of the lowest type of
humanity to be found in the North. Their appearance
was far from prepossessing. They shambled
over to the counter, elbowed their way through the
small group of customers and stood for a moment
watching Factor MacClaren wrapping up merchandise
purchased by the various members of the chattering
party.</p>
<p>Behind the pages of his magazine, Dick covertly
watched them. Thus far, they had made no effort
to approach or accost Nichols, whose indolent form
slouched on one of the high stools, which had been
placed before the counter. To all appearances, the
two newcomers were entirely oblivious of the presence,
or even the existence of the big prospector.
Not once had their dark, insolent glances been turned
in his direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>But&mdash;and here was a curious thing&mdash;each passing
moment seemed to bring them closer and closer to
the man under police surveillance. They accomplished
this maneuver in a manner that would have
done credit to an experienced horseman, jockeying
for position at the commencement of a race. Almost
imperceptibly, and by degrees, they had edged
nearer, covering the short space separating them
from the imperturbable Nichols without once creating
the impression that the thing had been done
intentionally.</p>
<p>They were so close now that Nichols might easily
have reached out with one long arm and placed it on
the shoulder of either one of them. The prospector&rsquo;s
eyes were upon Factor MacClaren and his
face was perfectly immobile and expressionless. If
he was aware of the proximity of the murderous
looking pair, he gave no sign of it. He moved
slightly in his chair but completely ignored them.
Dick had about come to the conclusion that the two
half-breeds were not those whom Corporal Rand had
expected, when a very suspicious movement on the
part of Murky caught his alert gaze. With a lazy,
seemingly unconscious action, the prospector&rsquo;s hand
was thrust in a pocket, held there for a moment,
then was drawn forth, palm down and thrust quickly
towards the nearer of the two stalky forms. Swift
as the movement had been, Dick had, nevertheless,
caught a glimpse of the roll of bills so secretly exchanged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The half-breeds lingered for a very short time
near their benefactor, then advanced along the counter
and purchased several plugs of smoking tobacco
from Factor MacClaren. Completing this transaction,
they turned nonchalantly and walked out. No
sooner had the door closed after them, than Murky
rose and sauntered over to the window. He was
still gazing out when the door creaked again and
Corporal Rand entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been out inspecting MacClaren&rsquo;s new warehouse,&rdquo;
he announced cheerfully. &ldquo;You must be
expecting a large volume of business this winter.&rdquo;
He addressed the factor.</p>
<p>Walter MacClaren put down a large bundle of
merchandise and paused to wipe his perspiring face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;trading is good this year.
Just now the indications are especially bright. Although
this is just the beginning of the fur season,
I&rsquo;ve never seen better prices or the promise of so
large a trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian trappers are out everywhere,&rdquo; Corporal
Rand remarked. &ldquo;Yesterday I ran into a party of
them going out to the Big Smoky. They told me
they expected a good catch this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacClaren nodded as he went back to his work.
The mounted policeman moved over to the table
where Dick sat and placed a friendly hand on that
young man&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can pry you loose from that magazine,&rdquo; he
declared jovially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask you to step up
to my room for a few minutes for a private consultation.
No! Don&rsquo;t look frightened. I really don&rsquo;t
intend to take you into custody just yet. If you&rsquo;ll
bring your cribbage board and a new deck of cards,
I&rsquo;ll promise to be lenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grinning, Dick got to his feet. Well he knew
that the game he and the corporal would presently
play had nothing whatever to do with cribbage.
Something a great deal more important was at stake
just then&mdash;he could tell that from the serious,
thoughtful expression so poorly concealed under
Rand&rsquo;s effort at deception. The jovial manner, the
subterfuge of the cribbage board and the forced
laugh&mdash;all were intended for the eyes and ears of the
man who still stood near the window, and whose
suspicions, under any circumstances, must not be
aroused.</p>
<p>With a quickening pulse, Dick followed the policeman
through the door at the back of the trading
room, down a long hallway and into an immaculately
neat and clean-looking chamber, which MacClaren
always reserved for the use of various members of
the R. N. W. M. P. who came frequently to the post.</p>
<p>Rand motioned his visitor to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nichols handed a roll of bills to two half-breeds
who entered the room shortly after your departure,&rdquo;
Dick replied quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you happen to overhear any of their conversation?&rdquo;
came the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; the other informed him. &ldquo;The
breeds moved close to Nichols, but pretended to be
interested in the customers and the trading. Until
he put his hand in his pocket and passed the money
quickly over to one of the half-breeds, you never
would have known that Murky realized that the two
were standing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. At least nothing of importance. The
pair bought some tobacco and walked out. Nichols
went to the window and seemed to be watching them
as they hurried away. You came in yourself a moment
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Dick, you&rsquo;ve done well,&rdquo; approved the
corporal. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve helped me to weld the first link
in the chain. In time, I hope to piece together the
other links that will lead me to the solution of this
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused, but hesitated about
asking any questions. To what mystery did Rand
refer? He waited patiently for the policeman&rsquo;s next
words:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;In fairness to you, Dick, I think it&rsquo;s advisable to
give you some information regarding this case. I&rsquo;ve
already hinted to you that Murky Nichols is under
police surveillance. We&rsquo;ve been watching him
closely for a long time. His movements have been
suspicious. Although he professes to be a prospector,
he really hasn&rsquo;t done a tap of work in the last
four years. He always has a large amount of money
and he spends it liberally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he get this money?&rdquo; Dick inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From three or four different sources. To my
certain knowledge, there are two men who pay him
money regularly. One is Fred Hart and the other
is Tim O&rsquo;Connell. Both of these men are packers
in the summer and freighters in the winter. They
have almost a monopoly on the transportation business
in this particular section of the country. The
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay, in addition to several of the independent
fur companies and free traders, give practically
all of their business to these men. Last year
Factor MacClaren&rsquo;s business alone amounted to
nearly five thousand dollars. Hart and O&rsquo;Connell
get the preference over the other packers and freighters
because they are more efficient, careful and responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Dick, as the thought suddenly occurred
to him, &ldquo;perhaps Nichols is a silent-partner
in their enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand smiled at the other&rsquo;s quick perception, but he
slowly shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the conclusion we came to ourselves. Investigation,
carried out secretly, proves that he isn&rsquo;t.
No&mdash;the thing goes deeper than that. Nichols is
engaged in some secret and probably illegal enterprise.
Little by little we&rsquo;ve been picking up new
clues&mdash;making new discoveries. We&rsquo;ve found nothing
incriminating yet, but I don&rsquo;t believe it will be
very long before we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the money that exchanged hands
today? What business dealing do you suppose
Nichols could have with those two hard-looking customers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of them are thieves, but we haven&rsquo;t yet
been able to prove anything against them. For several
weeks past we&rsquo;ve suspected that either they&rsquo;re
in Murky&rsquo;s employ or that the breeds come to him
to sell stolen goods. The fact that Nichols paid
them money today is a pretty strong indication that
one or other of these suppositions is correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand paused to fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nichols is shrewd and clever,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s amiable and well-liked. He has many friends
in every part of the country. Notwithstanding,
there&rsquo;s a deep, treacherous side to his nature, a diabolical
cleverness that can find its outlet only
through criminal channels. Your friend, Sergeant
Richardson, believes firmly he&rsquo;s a master crook, a
sort of genius at crime, and that he contrives to
distract attention from himself by assuming this
role of genial, lazy, ignorant prospector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed outright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Richardson has a vivid imagination,&rdquo;
he declared, &ldquo;but very often in cases of this kind his
deductions prove correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough!&rdquo; Constable Rand puffed reflectively.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s worked out a very unusual theory in
regard to Nichols. It was shortly after the finding
of old Daddy McInnes&rsquo; body that he told me about
it. The whole thing is so extraordinary, so wild,
and yet so convincing that we&rsquo;ve decided to look into
it. It&rsquo;s this theory that we&rsquo;re working on now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me about it?&rdquo; pleaded Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. There&rsquo;s no harm done, that I can see.
Besides the sergeant informed me that I could trust
you implicitly. He even hinted that you contemplated
joining the force. What about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Dick was forced to admit, his face
red with embarrassment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made application to
the commissioner at Ottawa, but I&rsquo;m not sure that
anything will ever come of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so certain,&rdquo; Rand shook his head. &ldquo;We
need more men, especially here in the North. You&rsquo;d
have to spend a period of training at Regina
though.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;But to go on with Richardson&rsquo;s theory,&rdquo; resumed
the corporal. &ldquo;Incredible as it may at first appear,
it&rsquo;s logical enough. I&rsquo;ll give you its substance
briefly: Nichols is the leader of a small band of
crooks. Hart and O&rsquo;Connell are his accomplices, or,
what I should say his accessories&mdash;they&rsquo;re both honest.
Nichols never actually commits any crime himself.
He purchases fur, which he knows is stolen
and disposes of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through Hart and O&rsquo;Connell, I suppose,&rdquo; Dick
put in. &ldquo;They take it to civilization and sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;re a thousand miles from the mark.
Hart and O&rsquo;Connell play a less important part in
this scheme. Murky is more clever than that. He
disposes of his own stuff in a more original and
unheard-of way. Hart and O&rsquo;Connell merely supply
him with means of transportation&mdash;pack horses
in summer and dog teams in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand paused again and rose to his feet.
He tiptoed softly to the door, opened it and looked
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there might be someone in the hallway,&rdquo;
he apologised. &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t be too careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed the door, a slight frown on his face,
and went back to the chair opposite Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t be bothered. Where was I&mdash;oh,
yes&mdash;As I just said Hart and O&rsquo;Connell supply
Nichols with ponies or dog teams, depending
upon the season, and Murky proceeds to transport
his stolen fur to the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the coast!&rdquo; gasped Dick. &ldquo;How could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sat and stared incredulously at the grave,
serious face of the man opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fooling me, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit! Richardson feels that he&rsquo;s absolutely
sure that such is the case. I&rsquo;m almost convinced
myself. Every clue that we&rsquo;ve been able to pick up
since the Sergeant hit upon this wild theory seems
to bear him out. Another thing, there&rsquo;s the case of
Daddy McInnes. The story I told in the trading
room an hour ago was an elaboration of or a tampering
with the true facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy McInnes was murdered. A blow on the
back of the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, we don&rsquo;t want anyone to suspect&mdash;least
of all Nichols&mdash;that we know McInnes came
to a violent end. That would spoil everything. We
never would catch Murky if a breath of this ever
leaked out. The abrasion on the back of Daddy&rsquo;s
head caused a little comment, but we took immediate
steps to check it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We claimed that in his weakened and starved
condition, McInnes fainted and fell, his head striking
a rock. Everyone believes it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should Nichols&mdash;I mean, what motive
would he have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy found the pass and came through it. If
he had lived, its exact location would have become
public property. In that event, Murky Nichols
would have been out of a job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what about Hart and O&rsquo;Connell? They
must know where Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so. There is only one white
man in this country who could lead us unerringly to
Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass&mdash;and that person is Murky
Nichols!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">SERGEANT RICHARDSON&rsquo;S THEORY</span></h2>
<p>For the second time since coming to the room,
Corporal Rand strode to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be nervous today,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I pop
up here every few minutes like a jack-in-the-box.
Somehow, I can&rsquo;t get over the feeling that there
was really someone prowling about the hallway a
short time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; reassured Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly I am mistaken. There are times when
a thing like that will lay hold of you, and you don&rsquo;t
seem to be able to shake it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often experienced the same feeling,&rdquo; confessed
Dick. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closing the door, the mounted policeman helped
himself to a glass of water from a pitcher that stood
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you a brief outline of Richardson&rsquo;s
theory,&rdquo; he stated, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t made
everything quite clear. Are there any questions
you&rsquo;d like to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;about Hart and O&rsquo;Connell,&rdquo; Dick responded
quickly. &ldquo;According to what you have
said, these men have given Nichols money. After
listening to your story, that part of it doesn&rsquo;t seem
reasonable. If Murky uses their outfits to transport
stolen goods to the coast through Blind Man&rsquo;s
Pass, I should think he&rsquo;d be under obligation to
them, that he&rsquo;d pay them money instead of their
paying him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; Corporal Rand smiled approvingly.
&ldquo;That was my contention. I claimed it
was the one weak spot in Richardson&rsquo;s theory&mdash;but,
of course, the explanation is simple enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hart and O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s are freighters. They go
everywhere. They have almost a monopoly on the
transportation business. They have the government
mail contract from here to Edmonton. Occasionally,
perhaps not more than once or twice a year,
they have business that takes them to the west coast&mdash;across
Dominion Range. As you know this is a
long and roundabout trip, requiring weeks, sometimes
months for its completion. Consequently the
transportation rates to the west coast are high. No
one realizes this condition of affairs any better than
Nichols. He takes advantage of it for his own
gain. He draws up an agreement with the two
packers to handle all the west-coast business himself,
charging a very nominal rate for this service, and
killing two birds with one stone. You can see how
diabolical, how very clever the arrangement is. The
freight that goes through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass is a
mixed shipment. Part of it is stolen fur, the other
part is merchandise which the original shipper has
entrusted to the care of Hart or O&rsquo;Connell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;The scheme works beautifully,&rdquo; smiled Rand.
&ldquo;Both parties to the transaction reap a lovely profit.
Hart or O&rsquo;Connell charge the shipper the same price
that he would have to pay if his merchandise went
all the way round to the west coast through the Yellowhead
Pass. Murky can smile up his sleeve too,
because all expense of taking out his contraband
falls upon the willing shoulders of the two packers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of anything so clever,&rdquo; declared
Dick. &ldquo;Of course, Hart and O&rsquo;Connell are aware
of the existence of Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass. You don&rsquo;t
suppose they know where it is themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s Murky&rsquo;s own secret. Otherwise the
packers would never have entered into such an agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see it all very clearly now,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m anxious to know in what way I can be of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand hesitated for a moment before
making a reply. He sat in the chair opposite and
regarded Dick with appraising eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t definitely decided just what we are
going to do ourselves, but we intend to use you in
some capacity. I&rsquo;m waiting now to hear from Sergeant
Richardson. However, unless something unforseen
occurs, I imagine our program will be something
like this: Malemute Slade will continue in his
search for the pass; Constable Pearly&mdash;a new man
just recently transferred here from the Peace River
Detachment&mdash;will be detailed to keep close tab on
Hart and O&rsquo;Connell, while Sergeant Richardson and
myself will study every movement of the two half-breeds
and Murky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may take weeks, possibly months, before we&rsquo;ll
be able to accomplish much. We are compelled to
move very, very cautiously. If Nichols discovers
our interest in his affairs, we&rsquo;ll lose our only chance
of getting him. He&rsquo;s as slippery as an eel, and as
crafty as a fox. I don&rsquo;t believe there is another
person in the North with a wider acquaintance, or a
more thorough knowledge of conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t Hart and O&rsquo;Connell squeal if
Murky should refuse to take any more of their shipments
through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place they won&rsquo;t dare to, because the
shippers will hear of it and refuse to give the packers
another dollar&rsquo;s worth of business. Remember Hart
and O&rsquo;Connell have been reaping a golden harvest at
the shippers&rsquo; expense. In the second place, even if
they do squeal, we&rsquo;ll have no direct evidence against
Nichols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How then do you propose to catch Murky?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are several ways: One would be to find
the pass ourselves and then wait for Murky to come
through; another would be to follow a west-coast
shipment from the time it leaves the hands of Hart
and O&rsquo;Connell; still another, to locate Murky&rsquo;s cache
of stolen fur, and awaiting the next shipment
through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think Murky has such a cache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our theory is correct, he must have. In all
likelihood, he has two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of them!&rdquo; gasped Dick. &ldquo;What makes
you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands to reason that he has. In fact, it&rsquo;s
quite obvious. The stolen fur must be stored somewhere
before it is shipped. When it reaches the
coast, it must be stored again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one place to sell it&mdash;at the Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company&rsquo;s post at Fort Pennington&mdash;and
Murky isn&rsquo;t foolish enough to take that risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; asked Dick in amazement, &ldquo;that
he&rsquo;d continue to&mdash;that he&rsquo;s been hiding it out there
on the coast year after year, making no attempt to
sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no! We believe he hides it out there all
right. But we&rsquo;re pretty sure that he sells some of
it occasionally. We do know that two years ago
last summer he went to Seattle. He was away
about six months. When he returned he was rolling
in money and told a very interesting story about
a legacy he had received from a brother, recently
deceased. We believed the yarn then&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t
now! In fact,&rdquo; Rand spoke sarcastically, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
somewhat inclined to the opinion that while he was
there he met one or two unscrupulous gentlemen who
offered to accompany him up the coast for the fun
and profit to be derived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; laughed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He probably hasn&rsquo;t sold any of the fur since
then. I think that when you go out there, you&rsquo;ll
find that Richardson&rsquo;s theory is correct. There&rsquo;ll
be a big cache&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When <i>I</i> go out there?&rdquo; interrupted Dick, staring
in astonishment at the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you, Sandy and Toma. Surely, you&rsquo;d be
willing to do that much for us, Dick. Sergeant
Richardson said that you&rsquo;d jump at the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so sure that you&rsquo;ll find the cache, that
we&rsquo;re willing to pay all the expenses of the trip&mdash;and
a liberal reward in the bargain. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; choked Dick. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say enough. What
I want to know is&mdash;do you really mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never more serious in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rose to his feet and paced agitatedly back
and forth. His heart had jumped a few wild beats
before he could compose himself sufficiently to make
another effort to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want us to start?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as it can possibly be arranged. Toma
knows the route to the Yellowhead Pass; but after
that you&rsquo;ll have to chart your own course. We can
depend on you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned&mdash;yes. I won&rsquo;t presume
to speak for Sandy and Toma, yet I&rsquo;m pretty sure
they&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Corporal Rand and Dick
returned to the trading room, which was crowded.
Stalwart, dusky half-breed trappers, eager to purchase
supplies for impending excursions to favorite
trapping grounds, pushed and elbowed their way
through the throng awaiting their opportunity to
confer with Factor MacClaren. Indian women, resplendent
in bright shawls, bright-faced children
from the Catholic Mission, here and there the dark,
expressionless face and sinewy form of Cree hunters
and rivermen from the south&mdash;all of this queer blend
of humanity jostled forth and back, chattering excitedly.</p>
<p>At one side of the room, surrounded by an admiring
group, a tall, lanky half-breed youth was playing
a violin. Glancing that way, Dick&rsquo;s eyes lighted up
as he perceived the familiar figures of his two
friends, Sandy MacClaren, the factor&rsquo;s nephew, and
John Toma, the young Indian guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Toma, Sandy and Dick, following several years
of interesting adventures in the North, had become
greatly attached to each other. They were three
inseparables, who had learned to take the trials and
hardships of wilderness life as a matter of common
experience. In spite of many hard knocks, they
were still as eager to embark upon new adventures as
in the days when Dick and Sandy were newcomers to
that remote and inhospitable land.</p>
<p>Dick lost no time in rejoining his two chums.
With a friendly nod to Corporal Rand, he darted
through the crowd and administered a resounding
whack on the backs of Sandy and Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve returned at last,&rdquo; he greeted them
joyfully. &ldquo;Did you have any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet! We shot two moose,&rdquo; and the young
Scotchman immediately commenced a somewhat
rambling and disconnected account of their experiences.</p>
<p>At its conclusion, Dick feigned scepticism, winked
broadly at Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! The whole thing sounds fishy to me. I
don&rsquo;t believe you shot anything. If you actually
killed a moose it was because the poor thing fell
down and broke a leg. At two hundred yards a
blind man with a bow and arrow could out-shoot
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, wait and see. An Indian packer is
bringing over our two moose tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you pay him for them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>In attempting to evade Sandy&rsquo;s friendly upper-cut,
Dick stepped back just in time to be knocked flat by
a person hurrying across the room. From his position
on the floor, he looked up to see the man spring
to the door, open it, and dart outside.</p>
<p>It was the half-breed, who had received the roll
of money from Murky Nichols!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">TWO ENCOUNTERS IN ONE DAY</span></h2>
<p>An excited shout from Sandy drew Dick&rsquo;s attention
as he clambered to his feet. At the opposite
end of the trading room a gesticulating, wildly
vociferous crowd had gathered about the drooping
figure of Murky Nichols. The face of the prospector
was deathly pale, as he stood, one hand
clutching the counter, the other gripping firmly a
long-bladed hunting knife, which he held up for the
inspection of the crowd.</p>
<p>The scarlet-coated form of Corporal Rand advanced
through the milling throng and a moment
later, just as the three boys came hurrying up, the
policeman helped Nichols to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened, Murky?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some breed tried to knife me,&rdquo; choked the frightened
man, holding on to the chair for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; wheezed Murky. &ldquo;Never seen
him before. He came up while I was a standin&rsquo;
over there an&rsquo; first thing I knowed he made a slash
at me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Nichols trembled as he spoke, drawing attention
to the wide slit in his mackinaw shirt just below his
left arm-pit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the knife caught me when I
jumped back. Good thing I did or he&rsquo;d o&rsquo; got me
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he hurt you at all?&rdquo; inquired Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were lucky. You say you didn&rsquo;t know the
breed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight hesitation on the part of the prospector
was noted probably by only two persons in the room&mdash;Dick
and Corporal Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I ever set eyes on him, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he speak to you or did you speak to him
before he drew the knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Murky stated emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very queer the man should attack you without
provocation,&rdquo; mused Rand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely sure
you never saw him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slow flush mounted to Nichols&rsquo; weather-tanned
brow and for a split-second his eyes evaded the questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, corporal,&rdquo; he spoke testily, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t I been
tellin&rsquo; yuh. Don&rsquo;t even know what he looks like&mdash;it
all happened so sudden. If he should come walkin&rsquo;
in here in ten minutes from now I ain&rsquo;t so sure
I&rsquo;d recognize him. The feller must be crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks queer!&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s cool, unwavering
gaze met that of the prospector. &ldquo;Usually
there&rsquo;s a motive for an attack of this kind. As a
general thing, a man doesn&rsquo;t attempt to stab another
unless he has some real or fancied grievance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy, I tell yuh,&rdquo; persisted Nichols.</p>
<p>Rand turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do. I intend to take the
breed in custody. I ought to be able to run
him down in a few hours. Then we can question
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal turned without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation
and hurried away. He was gone almost before
Dick could collect his scattered wits and remark to
Sandy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I intended to tell him something, but
it&rsquo;s too late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be able to catch him at the stable,&rdquo;
said the quick-witted Sandy, seizing Dick&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys pushed their way through the
crowd, but a jam in front of the door delayed them.
Like themselves, everyone, so it seemed, wanted to
get out. They were caught in a drifting, struggling
current of over-curious half-breeds, were
jolted back and forth and, when they finally emerged,
panting and dishevelled, to the yard outside, they
perceived to their chagrin that Rand had already
mounted his horse and was speeding away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo; Dick sputtered. &ldquo;There he goes.
I might have given him information that would have
saved him a lot of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What information?&rdquo; demanded a person almost
at his elbow.</p>
<p>Neither Sandy nor Toma had spoken. Dick
wheeled quickly and looked up into a pair of steel-gray
eyes, at a coarse, brutal face. The man&rsquo;s
rough garb was that of a prospector or trapper.
None of the boys had ever seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What information?&rdquo; he repeated insolently.</p>
<p>Dick met the other&rsquo;s appraising gaze without
flinching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t speaking to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;m speaking to yuh. I asked
yuh what I consider is a decent, friendly question.
Yuh don&rsquo;t need to try any o&rsquo; your high an&rsquo; haughty
manner with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick completely ignored the insult, despite the fact
that it was difficult to suppress the surge of anger
that rose within him. He was fighting mad and his
fists clenched involuntarily, yet he turned to Sandy
and contrived, though the effort was difficult, to
speak calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down along the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s face fell as he swung into step beside his
friend, his right arm linked into Toma&rsquo;s. As they
struck off to the left, they were followed by the baleful,
mocking glare of Dick&rsquo;s newly discovered
enemy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Out of ear-shot, Sandy broke forth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, I&rsquo;m almost ashamed of you. Why did you
do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk away like that. It looks cowardly. I
never saw you do a thing like that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I did it,&rdquo; Dick confessed, &ldquo;except
that I had a hunch that if I let him pick a fight
with me, I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t explain it. Something
seemed to warn me to keep away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, you were afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that!&rdquo; Dick retorted hotly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
go back even now and &lsquo;mix-it&rsquo; with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to explain to you, Sandy. I have a
feeling that it woul&lsquo;d be foolhardy. Something more
than a mere quarrel or a fight is involved. That
man, whoever he is, had some secret purpose in view
when he accosted me just now. I don&rsquo;t know what
that purpose is, but I do know I&rsquo;m not going to
take any chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments they walked on in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can forget about it if you can,&rdquo; remarked
Sandy a little dryly.</p>
<p>Dick laughed good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll have any trouble doing that,&rdquo;
he responded quickly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much else to
think about. And that reminds me that I have some
big news for you and Toma. How would you
like to take a trip out to the coast this winter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Sandy stopped short in his tracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the coast!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that. Corporal Rand told me about it
today. He brought a letter from our old friend,
Sergeant Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further preliminary, Dick launched into
the story. Toma and Sandy listened with bated
breath while Dick gave them the particulars of the
theory which had been advanced by the mounted
police respecting the alleged operations of Murky
Nichols. Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass, the murder of Daddy
McInnes, the double cache of stolen fur and finally
the proposed expedition to the west coast to be
undertaken by the boys themselves&mdash;all became subjects
of absorbing interest and speculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I understand it,&rdquo; Sandy broke forth enthusiastically,
&ldquo;Sergeant Richardson is sending us out to
the coast because he believes we can find the cache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important undertaking,
and we ought to be proud that the police
have faith in our ability. Of course, we would
never have been given the chance if Inspector
Cameron wasn&rsquo;t so short of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make &rsquo;em mounted police glad they give us
chance to go,&rdquo; cut in Toma. &ldquo;If cache anywhere
along coast, we find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly will,&rdquo; said Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Walking leisurely along the banks of the river,
the boys made their plans. So interested had they
become, so absorbed in the contemplation of the
proposed journey, that they found themselves presently
out of sight of the trading post. They were
crossing a narrow gulch, when Dick stopped short,
glancing about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use going any farther,&rdquo; he declared laughingly.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s return to the post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy took note of their surroundings and he
too broke forth into an amused chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
sauntering along not paying the least bit of attention.
I had no idea we&rsquo;d gone so far. We&rsquo;re five
miles from Fort Good Faith. A hundred yards on
the other side of this gulch is where Run River
trail crosses the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sandy spoke, he turned back and led the way
to the top of the gulch. Spruce and poplar grew
thickly along the trail ahead. A light snow of a
few days before, sifting down through the trees,
had only partially covered the heavy carpet of dry
leaves and grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be several weeks yet before winter sets
in in earnest,&rdquo; observed Dick. &ldquo;I hope the mounted
police give us instructions to leave for the west
coast before it does come. If we travel light, we&rsquo;ll
reach the Yellowhead Pass long before the extremely
cold weather arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not snow enough,&rdquo; Toma shook his head disapprovingly.
&ldquo;No use start out until catch &rsquo;em plenty
snow for dog team. Mebbe no get snow for five,
six days yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Sandy looked up at the overcast
sky with a critical but approving gaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cloudy
right now. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it started to
snow this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too warm,&rdquo; Toma objected. &ldquo;Wind blow southwest.
Tomorrow chinook make like summer.
Mebbe it rain, but no snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well keep quiet, Sandy,&rdquo; grinned
Dick. &ldquo;Toma is a better weather prophet than you
are. He&rsquo;s seldom wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I think there&rsquo;s a storm brewing,&rdquo;
stubbornly persisted the young Scotchman. &ldquo;This
is the second week in October. Last year at this
time there was seven inches of snow on the ground
and the weather was ten below zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I look at it this way: if
the police are ready, we&rsquo;ll be ready too. Let the
chinook come. We&rsquo;ll start out on foot and buy our
grub-stake and dog team at Fort Wonderly, one
hundred miles south of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea! You&rsquo;re talking sense now, Dick.
Well&mdash;for the love of Pete!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s abrupt exclamation was caused by the
sudden appearance on the trail ahead of four men.
One of them they recognized instantly. It was the
person who had attempted to pick a quarrel with
Dick. Startled for a moment, the boys drew back
to the side of the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; cautioned Dick in a low
voice. &ldquo;If they attempt to start trouble, try to keep
away from them. We&rsquo;re no match for them. Besides,
they&rsquo;re armed and we aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pretending a nonchalance they did not feel, the
three boys strode forward again until they came
abreast of the oncoming and ominous quartette. In
the lead, Dick edged over to the side of the trail,
hoping that no attempt would be made to prevent
their passing. He was now within three feet of the
nearest of the party, and had almost begun to believe
that nothing would happen, when the four men
spread out quickly, completely barring their progress.
Dick looked across at two gray eyes that
glinted evilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess yuh better stop a while, sonny,&rdquo; sneered
the voice of the white man. &ldquo;Feel like answerin&rsquo;
that question now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any question to answer,&rdquo; retorted Dick,
looking straight at his tormentor, and then at the
three half-breeds, a villainous-appearing trio, who
stood ready and eager to leap forward at the first
word of command.</p>
<p>The white man stepped forward and confronted
Dick, one arm raised threateningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh better do some quick thinkin&rsquo; afore I whale
the tar outta yuh. Are yuh gonna answer that
question or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the short interval in which he stood there
undecided, a daring plan leaped into Dick&rsquo;s mind.
He would feign submission. He would agree to
answer the question. Then when the time came&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right,&rdquo; stammered Dick, simulating terror.
&ldquo;Wh-what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh know blamed well what I want. Back
there at the post &rsquo;bout an hour er two ago, you wuz
figgerin&rsquo; on givin&rsquo; that danged mountie a whole earful
o&rsquo; information. I heerd yuh tellin&rsquo; these young
friends o&rsquo; yourn. Out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The arm was raised again and Dick shrank back,
his eyes blinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike me and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he trembled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell everything. I promise I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s antagonist chuckled in triumph. It tickled
his vanity to perceive how easily he was winning
his case. He had his victim almost frightened out
of his wits. This young stripling who stood before
him hadn&rsquo;t the backbone of an eel. His arm dropped
and he slouched forward, completely off guard, and
leered into Dick&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>It was the opportunity that Dick had been looking
for. Crack! The blow was a smashing one and
wholly unexpected. The white man&rsquo;s feet skidded
out from under him; his heavy frame struck the
ground with a resounding impact. Before the half-breeds
had time to recover from their astonishment,
three fleeting forms shot through the opening and
took the turn in the trail, running at top speed.</p>
<p>A few moments later a bullet whizzed harmlessly
over their heads. The boys redoubled their efforts.
A second turn in the trail revealed a straggling party
of Indians returning from the post. At sight of
them, Sandy let out a whoop of joy. Help was at
hand. The danger was over. Panting like three
small locomotives, they sat down on a log and waved
a cheerful greeting as the Indians passed by.</p>
<p>When the last straggler had disappeared from
view, Sandy turned and smiled at his chum. There
was approval and admiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step over here and let me shake your hand.
Wow! I&rsquo;ll bet that fellow is still wondering if it
was really a tree that struck him. I&rsquo;ll give you all
the credit this time, Dick. There&rsquo;s no denying the
fact: You certainly answered his question!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">A MIDNIGHT CONFERENCE</span></h2>
<p>Corporal Rand returned with his half-breed
prisoner shortly after dark. The man was sulky and
refused to talk. Brought before Murky Nichols
by the mounted policeman, one might have thought
from his actions and demeanor that he had never
before set eyes upon the prospector. He stood
absolutely unmoved in the presence of the person
he had attempted to murder only a few hours before.
Rand&rsquo;s voice rang out sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the prisoner. Is he the man who
attempted to stab you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to cover his confusion, Nichols rubbed
his eyes with one large hairy hand. His face was
slightly pale and he rested his weight first on one
leg and then on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, corporal, I can&rsquo;t exactly say,&rdquo; he spoke
hesitatingly. &ldquo;He might be the one an&rsquo; again he
mightn&rsquo;t. He does look sort o&rsquo; familiar, but I see
so many Nitchies &rsquo;round here. I couldn&rsquo;t exactly
swear to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand smiled a little grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;There were quite a number of people present
in this room when the attempt upon your life was
made. It shouldn&rsquo;t be very difficult to find out
whether or not this man is the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nichols started forward with an exclamation of
surprise. He was staring at the prisoner now with
an intentness that seemed scarcely to be assumed.
Excitedly, he turned towards Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By golly, I know now, corporal, where I seen
him before,&rdquo; he declared in a loud and animated
voice. &ldquo;Up at the first portage on the Moose River.
He was workin&rsquo; there as a packer last summer
when I come through. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the man
we&rsquo;re looking fer atall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mounted policeman turned his head ever so
slightly and winked covertly at Dick, who, in company
with Sandy and Toma, stood a few feet away,
silent spectator in the interesting tableau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s the man, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Murky spoke positively. &ldquo;When
I stop to think about that little affair this afternoon,
an&rsquo; try to get a picture in my mind o&rsquo; the pesky breed
what made fer to knife me, there&rsquo;s one thing that
stands out. He was a tall man&mdash;not short like this
breed. I&rsquo;m tall myself, an&rsquo; I remember when I
jumped back to clear myself o&rsquo; the knife, I looked
straight acrost in his eyes. Now, it stands to reason,
corporal, that I couldn&rsquo;t o&rsquo; done that if it had o&rsquo;
been this feller here. I&rsquo;d o&rsquo; looked straight over
this man&rsquo;s head, now wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>With difficulty, Dick suppressed a laugh. Murky
Nichols was noted for his tall stature. Long and
lanky, he stood well over six feet and four inches in
height. The half-breed was stockily built and
inclined to be short. The top of his head reached
no higher than the point of Murky&rsquo;s protruding chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that your memory has revived,&rdquo; Corporal
Rand spoke sarcastically, &ldquo;we may be able to make
better progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick strode forward with the intention of drawing
the mounted policeman&rsquo;s attention to one detail
of the case that had evidently been overlooked. If
the half-breed, who confronted Nichols, was not the
person who had attempted to stab him, how would
it be possible to explain that person&rsquo;s hasty exit from
the trading room immediately following the attack?
Also, as Dick was well aware, the prisoner was the
same man who had received the roll of bills from
Murky earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Dick paused in amazement. Before he could
reach the policeman&rsquo;s side, he saw Rand stoop forward
and commence to unlock the prisoner&rsquo;s hand-cuffs.
Then, wonderingly, he watched the corporal
move back and permit the astonished half-breed to
go free. His voice broke the startled silence of the
room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re at liberty to go now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to cause yuh all this trouble,&rdquo; Nichols
apologised. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re doing the right thing, corporal.
He ain&rsquo;t the man what tried to knife me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman favored Murky with one swift
appraising glance, nodded absently and walked over
and took Dick&rsquo;s arm. Although he did not speak,
the light pressure of the corporal&rsquo;s fingers told
Dick that the policeman wished to see him. With
a mumbled apology to Sandy, Dick led the way to
his own room. When he had drawn up a chair for
his guest, he came immediately to the subject uppermost
in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>The policeman held up one hand in an impatient
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re about to tell me that I have made a very
serious blunder, aren&rsquo;t you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-well,&rdquo; stammered that young man, &ldquo;you can
hardly blame me, corporal. The man you just
released is guilty. I didn&rsquo;t see him when he attempted
to stab Murky, but I did see him when he escaped.
In spite of what Nichols told you, he did recognize
the breed. Murky lied. He&rsquo;s the same one who
received the roll of bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand grinned as he looked across at
Dick&rsquo;s puzzled, serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well aware of that,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;I too
am sure that the half-breed was Murky&rsquo;s assailant.
But I had a good reason for releasing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind my asking, what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>For a moment Rand did not reply. Apparently,
he had become absorbed in his own thoughts. He
had relaxed in his chair, his head bent forward, his
eyes studying the tips of his brightly polished boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I captured the half-breed this afternoon,&rdquo;
he spoke finally, &ldquo;I have been thinking that
very little is to be gained by holding him in custody.
Nichols will not prefer a charge against him because
he&rsquo;s afraid the fellow may squeal. The half-breed
himself, realizing the danger of his position, and
who is really more clever than I had at first supposed,
is attempting to save himself by keeping silent. Even
if we subjected him to a severe grilling, I doubt
very much whether we could get anything out of
him. It seems to me that the best way to deal with
the situation is to accept Murky&rsquo;s assertion that we
have captured the wrong man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I should think that by letting the half-breed
go, you&rsquo;d lose a chance to find out in what way
Murky and the breed are associated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the corporal. &ldquo;On
the contrary, I&rsquo;m quite sure we can find out more
now that I have set the half-breed free. I&rsquo;m playing
right into Murky&rsquo;s hands. He&rsquo;s laughing up
his sleeve at this very moment at the way he thinks
he&rsquo;s fooled the mounted police. He&rsquo;ll be inclined to
be a little careless. We can look for immediate
developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What developments?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Murky&rsquo;s first move will be to attempt to patch
up his differences with his former assailant. The
half-breed&rsquo;s motive for attacking Nichols can easily
be explained&mdash;money! No doubt, Murky had failed
to live up to an agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman paused to fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By watching the two of them, we will be pretty
sure to find out something,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
not badly mistaken, we will be able to secure evidence
against them within the next two or three
days. I intend to keep a close tab on the pair
from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stirred uneasily in his seat. There was a
question he wanted to ask, but he did not wish to
appear too eager. During a lull in the conversation,
however, he finally managed to pluck up sufficient
courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When would you like to have us start for the
west coast?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Sandy and Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re as eager to go as I am,&rdquo; replied Dick.</p>
<p>Corporal Rand drummed on the arm of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t start
right away,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The only difficulty is
that you will be compelled to take supplies for the
trip, and just now pack-horses would be inadvisable.
A dog team would be better, but there&rsquo;s no snow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking about that,&rdquo; Dick put in eagerly.
&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we travel on foot to Fort Wonderly
and buy our team and supplies there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo; approved Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we start in the morning?&rdquo; Dick asked impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick jumped up, his eyes shining, and strode
forward and grasped the corporal&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy and Toma will be tickled pink!&rdquo; he cried
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about yourself?&rdquo; smiled Rand.</p>
<p>Dick flushed to the roots of his hair. He grinned
sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I&rsquo;m pleased, of course. Who
wouldn&rsquo;t be with a chance like that. I can hardly
wait until we start, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grew suddenly more serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any further instructions to give us
before we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing except what I have already
told you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You know the route.
There are any number of trails leading south to the
Yellowhead Pass. After you have gone through
the pass and have turned north, you&rsquo;ll find only one
trail, very rough and difficult, which will take you
in a northwesterly direction to Fort Pennington.
From there your course will be straight west to the
Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;And there&mdash;on the coast, I mean&mdash;our real work
will commence,&rdquo; Dick smiled in anticipation.</p>
<p>Corporal Rand regarded the statement with approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Work</i> is the right name for it,&rdquo; he assured him.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt but that you&rsquo;ll all become
discouraged long before you find the cache. In
fact, you may never find it. You&rsquo;ll encounter dangers
and difficulties on every hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the cache will be guarded?&rdquo; asked
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost sure to be,&rdquo; Rand replied. &ldquo;Probably
by some Indian or half-breed. You&rsquo;ll be compelled
to move cautiously. If I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t take
too many chances. No telling what sort of a mess
you&rsquo;ll get in, if you aren&rsquo;t incessantly on the alert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick would have liked to ask the policeman a few
more questions, but decided not to as he observed
the other sleepily consulting his watch. The hour
was getting late. The sounds from the trading
room, which a short time before could be heard
faintly, had now entirely ceased. The place had
become enveloped in a deep and slumberous silence.</p>
<p>Corporal Rand suppressed a yawn, rose slowly to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were both in bed,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;If either one of us expects to get anything accomplished
tomorrow, it will be necessary to secure
some sleep. I&rsquo;ve had a rather hard day myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>With a friendly nod and a smile, he turned and
walked out of the room. Dick stood in the doorway
and watched him for a moment, a happy expression
on his face. Rand&rsquo;s figure continued down
the hallway. A few feet farther on was the corporal&rsquo;s
room. Dick stepped back to re-enter his
own chamber, when, to his surprise, he perceived
that the policeman did not even pause in front of
his own door, but went on instead to the end of the
hallway and immediately disappeared through a door
which opened to the yard outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone out to see if his horse is bedded down
for the night,&rdquo; thought Dick.</p>
<p>For some reason he could not himself explain,
Dick stood in his own doorway, awaiting the corporal&rsquo;s
return. The minutes passed by. A quarter
of an hour elapsed&mdash;and still no sign of the mounted
policeman. Growing impatient, Dick commenced
pacing back and forth along the hallway. Presently,
moved by an unexplained impulse, he dashed
into his room, seized his cap and followed in the
footsteps of Rand.</p>
<p>It was exceedingly dark outside. A heavy mist
moistened his face as he stared through the enveloping
gloom. He groped forward until he had found
the path that led to the stable, then hurried along it,
wondering what had happened to detain the corporal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Forty or fifty yards from the house he stopped
short in consternation. From his right came the
sound of voices. Hesitating for a brief moment, he
struck forth again in the direction of the sound,
walking on tiptoes, his pulses pounding. Quite unexpectedly,
there loomed before him the dark shape
of the company&rsquo;s warehouse. It was a large, square
building, constructed entirely of logs. Here he
came to an abrupt pause and crouched down close
to the wall, trembling at his own audacity.</p>
<p>Immediately around the corner from him were
two men, talking in guarded tones. Dick listened
intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh can do this thing a hull lot better than I
can,&rdquo; drawled the voice of Murky Nichols. &ldquo;Yuh
gotta fix it up somehow jes&rsquo; as soon as yuh possibly
can. Tomorrow mornin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t none too soon, La
Qua, &rsquo;cause there ain&rsquo;t no tellin&rsquo; what that danged
breed&rsquo;ll be up to next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh mean yuh want me to get him outta the
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there ain&rsquo;t no other way&mdash;yes!&rdquo; calmly answered
Murky. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to take no more
chances with him. I gotta know he&rsquo;s gonna get
right down to business an&rsquo; no more foolin&rsquo;. Yuh can
tell him we&rsquo;ll give him fifty dollars more fer the next
bunch o&rsquo; pelts he brings down. I won&rsquo;t go a dime
higher &rsquo;an that an&rsquo; if he squawks I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; yuh
permission to pick him off any time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Should o&rsquo; done that long time ago,&rdquo; growled the
other. &ldquo;Yuh can&rsquo;t trust him. Yuh ain&rsquo;t the only
one he&rsquo;s nearly got with that blamed knife o&rsquo; his.
He nearly killed one o&rsquo; my best packers less &rsquo;an a
week ago in a scrap over a card game. I tell yuh,
I hate to have him around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; the same, he comes in pretty handy,&rdquo; Murky
Nichols declared. &ldquo;Take the case of Daddy McInnes,
fer example. None o&rsquo; yuh fellers would o&rsquo;
dared to do what he done. Both you an&rsquo; Bremner
was in the party guardin&rsquo; the pass when the ol&rsquo; man
came through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the first one who seen him,&rdquo; protested the
other hotly. &ldquo;It was me what told this breed, Testola,
to go after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so, but yuh wouldn&rsquo;t o&rsquo; done it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes had widened with understanding and
horror. He crouched low, scarcely daring to breathe.
A feeling of nausea was followed by a surge of
anger and disgust. The two men were vicious and
evil&mdash;absolutely heartless. At first, he had not recognized
the voice of Murky&rsquo;s companion, but a certain
quality in the tone, a peculiar inflection, stirred
presently his groping memory. It was the voice of
the red-bearded man&mdash;the person who had attempted
to stop him on the trail!</p>
<p>A short silence was broken by Nichols&rsquo; question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do yuh expect to be ready to send the next
shipment?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about ready now,&rdquo; came the quick answer.
&ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; it through tomorrow
night. If we do, I&rsquo;m gonna start from the same
place I did last time&mdash;the little shack near the foot
o&rsquo; Settlement Mountain. We&rsquo;ll have eight pack-horses,
belonging&rsquo; tuh Fred Hart, an&rsquo; five o&rsquo; our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Hart got much stuff this time?&rdquo; inquired
Murky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout three thousand pounds. The rest o&rsquo; the
shipment belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick rose cautiously to his feet and commenced
to beat a panicky retreat. It would never do to be
caught eavesdropping. If he fell into Murky&rsquo;s
hands at that moment, his life would be forfeit.</p>
<p>Careful as he was, it seemed to Dick that his
footsteps must have been heard plainly. A moment
later this feeling became a certainty. There came
to his ears a startled, anxious exclamation from one
of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did yuh hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been the wind,&rdquo; reassured the
other.</p>
<p>His heart beating wildly, Dick dropped to the
ground and wormed his way forward on his hands
and knees. A few yards farther on, he sprang to
his feet again and bolted away in the direction of
the house. Suddenly there appeared immediately
ahead the shadowy figure of a man. Dick stopped
short in his tracks, shaking in every limb.</p>
<p>His retreat was cut off!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">MURKY TAKES A HAND</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice was Corporal Rand&rsquo;s. Dick&rsquo;s sigh of
relief was more like an explosive gasp. He tottered
forward a few steps and grasped the sleeve of the
policeman&rsquo;s coat, clinging there like a person who
had found a friendly haven in the center of a whirlpool.
Gradually he recovered his self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see them too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See whom?&rdquo; demanded the corporal, whispering.
&ldquo;What do you mean? What are you doing out
here? I thought I&rsquo;d left you in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;but first we&rsquo;d better
go to my room. We&rsquo;re not safe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the house a few moments later, they
made their way in silence along the hallway and
entered Dick&rsquo;s room. Here the light from the oil
lamp, which stood on the table, seemed very bright
and cheerful to their eyes, which had become accustomed
to the intense darkness outside. Rand
started forward in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, my boy, you&rsquo;re as white as a
ghost! What&rsquo;s happened? What were you doing
outside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were gone so long I followed you,&rdquo; explained
Dick. &ldquo;What detained you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went out to the stable to look after my horse.
I put hay in the manger and then gave him a sheaf
of oats. I curried and bedded him down. Of
course, it took a little time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t hear voices&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Rand replied, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything out-of-the-ordinary
until after I had left the stable and
heard you running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started out for the stable myself,&rdquo; said Dick,
&ldquo;but in the darkness I took the wrong path, the one
toward the warehouse. I heard someone talking
and I thought it was you at first, but as I came closer
I made out the voices of Murky Nichols and a man
named La Qua. I have some startling information
to give you, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy! What is it, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaws are sending a pack-train through
Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand became visibly excited. A look of amazement
swept over his face, then, to Dick&rsquo;s surprise, he
moved forward quickly and blew out the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light here may arouse their suspicions if
they&rsquo;re still outside. We&rsquo;ll sit in the dark for a
while. But go on, Dick&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested. What
else did you overhear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pack-train will set out from the vicinity of
Settlement Mountain&mdash;wherever that is. There&rsquo;s a
small cabin there. La Qua said there would be thirteen
horses in the train. They&rsquo;re taking through a
little freight for Hart, about three thousand pounds.
The rest of the stuff belongs to Murky and his confederates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our chance. You&rsquo;re a jewel, Dick! Information
like this is what we&rsquo;ve been looking for for
months,&rdquo; exulted the mounted policeman. &ldquo;I happen
to know where Settlement Mountain is. Thirty
miles from here. Between Big Lake and the Settlement
House River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mounted policeman struck a match in order
to consult his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly one o&rsquo;clock now,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No
sleep for me tonight. Your information has upset
all my plans, Dick, and yours too. Just as soon as I
think the coast is clear, I&rsquo;m going to steal out, saddle
my horse and ride over to see Sergeant Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about our trip to the west coast?&rdquo; Dick
asked. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be foolish for us to go by way
of the Yellowhead Pass now that there&rsquo;s a chance to
follow Murky&rsquo;s pack-train and discover the much
shorter route through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it certainly would,&rdquo; agreed the corporal.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I just said that your information has
upset all our plans. We must make new ones right
away to fit the circumstances. Also it will be necessary
for us to move hurriedly and secretly. Instead
of sending you south tomorrow morning&mdash;or
this morning, to be exact&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to ask the
three of you to start as quickly as possible for the
Big Lake country, which is almost due west of here.
You&rsquo;d better pick out three fast ponies and head
straight for Wandley&rsquo;s post&mdash;you know where that
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had often heard of Wandley&rsquo;s post, although
he had never been there himself. Wandley was a
free trader, well known in the North, having for
many years conducted a thriving trade with the
Indians. His store or trading post was situated a
few miles south of Big Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick in answer to Rand&rsquo;s question,
&ldquo;I know where it is. I met Wandley himself about
a year ago. It&rsquo;s about twenty-five miles over there,
and you follow the Settlement House River trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand stepped closer to Dick and spoke in an undertone:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime before noon today, Constable Pearly&mdash;the
new man I told you about&mdash;will be at Wandley&rsquo;s.
I&rsquo;ll give you a message for him. This message
will explain who you are and why I have sent
you. The four of you, Constable Pearly, Sandy,
Toma and yourself will continue along the Settlement
House trail until you come to a bend in the
river. At this point you&rsquo;ll leave the trail, strike
straight off through the woods and make camp at
the lower end of the bend just above the river.
Here you will remain in concealment until Sergeant
Richardson and I join you&mdash;sometime before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do then?&rdquo; Dick asked a little
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will depend&mdash;&rdquo; the corporal hesitated,
&ldquo;upon circumstances and Sergeant Richardson. He
will be in command&mdash;not I. But I imagine, at least
it is very reasonable to suppose, that we&rsquo;ll start at
once for the outlaws&rsquo; rendezvous, their meeting
place near the foot of Settlement Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it spoil everything if the outlaws see
us?&rdquo; put in Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s exactly what we don&rsquo;t want to
happen. We&rsquo;ll be compelled to move very carefully.
Our only chance of finding Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass
will be to follow La Qua and his pack-train at a safe
distance. We mustn&rsquo;t be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll arrest La Qua and his men as
soon as they get to the pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. I think a better plan would be to follow
them straight through to the coast&mdash;to the big
cache they must have there. That is a suggestion
I&rsquo;m going to make to Sergeant Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face fell. He was keenly disappointed.
The trip to the west coast, the search for the cache
of stolen fur, had suddenly, because of this new development,
gone glimmering. Constable Pearly and
Corporal Rand would probably be the ones now
chosen for this task. There was too much at stake,
the danger attending the task of following the outlaws
was too great to permit of any bungling. Here
was a job that required older heads and more experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that lets us out,&rdquo; said Dick disconsolately.
&ldquo;Sergeant Richardson wouldn&rsquo;t hear of Sandy,
Toma and I going out there alone&mdash;following the
pack-train, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand took Dick&rsquo;s arm and gave it a
friendly squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. But don&rsquo;t feel badly about it,
Dick, we may have other important work for you.
If I happen to be the one chosen to trail along after
La Qua, I&rsquo;ll speak to the sergeant about you and the
chances are that he may consent to the three of you
accompanying me. I&rsquo;ll promise to do all I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be splendid of you,&rdquo; Dick blurted out.
&ldquo;All of us will appreciate your kindness. I don&rsquo;t
know how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try,&rdquo; laughed the policeman. &ldquo;Everything
will be all right, I assure you. Where are your two
friends sleeping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re bunking in the room next to the factor&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
answered Dick. &ldquo;Shall I go and wake
them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until I go. First of all, I&rsquo;d like to be sure
about the ponies. Unless you have them, you&rsquo;ll
never be able to get over to Wandley&rsquo;s in time to
meet Pearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy and I have a pony each,&rdquo; Dick assured
him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re out in the stable now with four
others, which belong to Factor MacClaren. We&rsquo;ll
pick out one of Mr. MacClaren&rsquo;s horses for Toma.
If you say the word, we can saddle-up and be away
from here in less than fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit!&rdquo; Corporal Rand declared.
&ldquo;However, it will not be necessary for you to start
as soon as that. I think you&rsquo;d better remain for
about three-quarters of an hour after I leave. It
might be a good idea to take emergency rations and
an extra blanket or two. In eight or ten hours
there may be a decided change in the temperature.
It is always best to be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mounted policeman tip-toed softly over to
the table, struck a match and re-lit the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dick,&rdquo; he spoke hurriedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
leave you. In a very few minutes I&rsquo;ll be hitting
the trail. I want you to remember everything I&rsquo;ve
told you&mdash;but above all, be cautious and careful.
When the time comes, wake Sandy and Toma and
make as little noise as possible. Unless it is absolutely
necessary, don&rsquo;t disturb Factor MacClaren.&rdquo;
He turned and held out his hand. &ldquo;Good-bye, and
good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Dick, accompanying the corporal
as far as the door. &ldquo;I hope everything goes well
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later, the door had closed behind the
trim, athletic figure and Dick was left with his mind
whirling confusedly. The events of the night, incident
following incident so closely, formed a chaotic
picture, which passed in review before his weary
eyes. With difficulty, he stifled a yawn at the same
time looking a wee bit covetously at the clean, white
bed at the far side of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here for ten or fifteen minutes before
I steal over to wake Toma and Sandy. Gee, I&rsquo;m so
tired I don&rsquo;t even dare to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began a restless pacing back and forth
across the room, occasionally glancing up at the
little clock that stood on a shelf near the door.
The minutes seemed interminable. A cold sweat
broke out upon his face, his hands twitched nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still five minutes more,&rdquo; sighed the impatient
young man. &ldquo;This suspense is terrible. I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight noise in the hallway outside riveted his
attention. He swung about on his heel, took a few
steps forward, then stood stock still, shaking with
excitement. It seemed as if some ghostly hand was
opening the door. Slowly, a few inches at a time,
it swung on its hinges, and presently the bearded,
uncouth face of Murky Nichols appeared through
the aperture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stayin&rsquo; up kind o&rsquo; late, ain&rsquo;t yuh?&rdquo; he drawled
out in an insinuating voice.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s two hands went up to his chin. He made
a gesture of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up all night with this pesky toothache,&rdquo;
he said a little shakily. &ldquo;Nothing that I can do has
seemed to help very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murky pushed his way into the room, his evil
mouth twisted into a sneer. At the same time, Dick
dropped back, edging his way over near the table,
where his rifle stood. Murky&rsquo;s voice broke an interval
of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shore feel sorry for yuh, young feller,&rdquo; he
grimaced. &ldquo;Toothache ain&rsquo;t no fun. Ain&rsquo;t anything
I can do, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;it will stop aching presently,
I hope. Thank you, just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he glanced furtively at the clock. It
was now twenty minutes after one&mdash;time to wake
Sandy and Toma. In less than half an hour they
were due to start for the Wandley post. His problem
now was to get rid of Nichols. On some pretext
or other he must induce Murky to leave the
room. But how?</p>
<p>Dick groaned inwardly as the prospector yanked
forward a chair and sat down. All the while his
black, penetrating eyes were studying him closely.
His manner and expression showed only too plainly
that he was not in the least deceived by Dick&rsquo;s lie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t help yuh, I can keep yuh company,&rdquo; he
remarked, his thin lips curling up at the corners in
a faint indication of a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no, that won&rsquo;t be necessary,&rdquo; Dick hastened
to tell him. &ldquo;You must be tired yourself. It has
stopped paining me a little now and I think I&rsquo;ll pop
into bed. You&rsquo;d better go to your own room,
Murky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With exasperating slowness, Nichols fumbled in
a pocket for tobacco and pipe. He stretched out his
long legs at the end of a few minutes, puffing contentedly.
Evidently, he had no intention of moving
just then.</p>
<p>Dick glanced at the clock again. He had grown
desperate&mdash;and angry. Back and forth he paced,
one hand held to his chin, trying to think of some
way in which he might outwit the imperturbable
prospector. Anger, finally, overcame his caution and
he stopped short in front of the lanky, indolent
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to get out,&rdquo; he heard himself
saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nichols looked up into Dick&rsquo;s indignant face,
grinned exasperatingly, and rose lazily to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, if yuh say so. I jes&rsquo; happened
to see your light under the door an&rsquo; I thought I&rsquo;d
drop in. Feel kind o&rsquo; nervous myself after what
happened this afternoon. Don&rsquo;t care atall &rsquo;bout
goin&rsquo; tuh bed. Guess I&rsquo;ll walk up an&rsquo; down the hall
fer a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still grinning, he opened the door and went out.
That he actually intended to remain in the hallway
for a time, there could be no doubt. His suspicions
had become aroused and he had shown by his actions
that he was frankly skeptical of Dick&rsquo;s story. Standing
guard outside, he had his youthful suspect almost
as completely under surveillance as if he had
remained in the room.</p>
<p>Dick bolted and locked his door and made ready
for his departure. Then he blew out the light and
sat down on the edge of the bed&mdash;waiting! Tears
of rage and exasperation welled into his eyes. They
were delayed now&mdash;and no immediate prospect of a
start. How long would Nichols keep watch in the
hallway? Dick gritted his teeth and swore vengeance
upon the wily outlaw.</p>
<p>The wind, rattling at the window, suddenly gave
him an idea. The window! Funny he hadn&rsquo;t
thought about that before! It would be a simple
task to raise the sash and slip around the building to
Sandy&rsquo;s and Toma&rsquo;s room. Once there he would
tap lightly on the pane outside until Toma, ever a
restless sleeper, would come to admit him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>A grim smile played around the corners of his
mouth as he thought about Murky standing guard
just outside his door to prevent his escape. He was
half-chuckling to himself as he tugged at the sash
there in the darkness. It went up with only a slight
squeak, and Dick slipped through the opening with
a wildly exultant heart.</p>
<p>Hurrying around the house, a few moments later
he stood just outside the sleeping boys&rsquo; window.
With his bared knuckles, he wrapped softly on a
square of glass, continuing intermittently until a
shadow appeared on the opposite side, and a sleepy
voice demanded to know what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up!&rdquo; Dick called softly.</p>
<p>Toma complied willingly enough, and it was not
long before Dick stood within the room.</p>
<p>Whispering a word of warning to the young
Indian guide, he pulled a blanket from the bed and
threw it down in front of the door. Then he lit the
lamp. In night attire, rubbing his eyes sleepily,
Toma regarded his friend in wonderment. What
sort of trick was this? Dick&rsquo;s and Sandy&rsquo;s pranks
were well known to him, and, judging from the
broad smile that quickly lit up his usually mobile
features, it was apparent that he believed that Sandy
was to be made the victim of another practical joke.
However, Dick hurriedly disillusioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fooling this time, Toma,&rdquo; he whispered into
the Indian&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;It may be a life or death matter.
The police want our help. We haven&rsquo;t a minute to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we do?&rdquo; asked Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re to carry a message to Constable Pearly
at Wandley&rsquo;s post. It is nearly two in the morning
now. We must get there before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How we go so fast like that?&rdquo; Toma wanted to
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ponies,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;Wake Sandy up
while I gather together a few things we may need.
If Sandy starts talking before he is fully awake,
shove a pillow in his mouth. Get busy! We&rsquo;ll have
to hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">WANDLEY&rsquo;S POST</span></h2>
<p>The boys reached Wandley&rsquo;s Post shortly after
twelve o&rsquo;clock and just in time to intercept Constable
Pearly, who had arrived early and was saddling up
in preparation for his departure. Their ponies covered
with mud and lather, Dick and his two companions
dashed into the compound and came to an
abrupt halt not twenty feet from the policeman himself,
who had come rushing to the door of the stable
at the first sound of clattering hoofs.</p>
<p>Dick stumbled from his mount and limped forward
with the message in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Corporal Rand at Fort Good Faith,&rdquo; he
explained, presenting the letter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dick Kent.
These are my two friends, Sandy MacClaren and
John Toma. At Corporal Rand&rsquo;s request we rode
over from Fort Good Faith this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal acknowledged the introduction with
a friendly smile and a hand-clasp for each of the
three mud-bespattered messengers. Then he tore up
the envelope. As he read its contents, a slight frown
settled and overspread his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is important news. Thanks very much for
bringing it over. I see that the three of you are to
go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s what we understood,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>
<p>Pearly rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few miles from here to our destination.
You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to rest and get
something to eat before we start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy greeted this declaration with an exclamation
of approval. The boys were ravenously hungry
and so stiff and sore that they could scarcely walk.
Loss of sleep and the hard ride from Fort Good
Faith had worn Dick&rsquo;s endurance to a shred. He
was nearly tottering as he reached out for the bridle-reins
of his pony and led the fagged and foot-sore
little beast through the open door of the stable.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, having cared for their tired
mounts, they accompanied Constable Pearly to
Wandley&rsquo;s trading room. Just outside the door,
Dick, happening to glance through the window, drew
back suddenly with a cry of surprise. Seated at one
of the tables was the burly figure of La Qua, and
immediately opposite, their heads bent forward in
discussion, were the two half-breeds who had played
such a conspicuous part in the affairs of the previous
day. Dick seized Pearly&rsquo;s arm, just as the latter
reached for the latch-string.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go in there, constable,&rdquo; he declared
excitedly, his voice hoarse and tremulous. &ldquo;Quick!
Let&rsquo;s get away from here. If we step inside, it&rsquo;ll
spoil everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Sandy&rsquo;s remonstrances and the policeman&rsquo;s
puzzled and questioning look, Dick hurriedly
led the way back to the compound before he could
be induced to offer a single word of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s La Qua,&rdquo; he broke forth eagerly, &ldquo;the man
who will be in charge of the pack-train Murky is
sending over to Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass tonight. He was
sitting in there at one of the tables. He&rsquo;s already
suspicious of me, and it would never do to meet him
again now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s La Qua?&rdquo; Pearly wished to
know.</p>
<p>Dick nodded his head emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure. He was over at Good Faith
yesterday&mdash;in fact, until one o&rsquo;clock this morning&mdash;consulting
with Murky Nichols. One of the two
men with him is the half-breed Corporal Rand arrested
for attempting to stab Nichols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stab Nichols!&rdquo; Pearly&rsquo;s face lit up with sudden
interest. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t heard about it. When did this
happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I thought
perhaps Rand had mentioned it to you in his letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Pearly, &ldquo;he had too many other
things to tell me. Most of his message was taken
up with instructions which we are to follow as soon
as we leave this post.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s dispirited face clouded still more as the
moments passed. Unable longer to withstand the
gnawing demands of his stomach, he stepped forward
and demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about something to eat? Just because that
blamed outlaw is sitting in there, is no reason why
we should all go hungry. Constable Pearly, isn&rsquo;t
there something you can suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; smiled the constable, &ldquo;I can easily
arrange that. But first we&rsquo;d better find a more suitable
hiding place than this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the loft in the stable?&rdquo; proposed
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good a place as any,&rdquo; Pearly decided, glancing
across at Sandy&rsquo;s wan and disconsolate features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hustle back to the trading room and purchase a
few things for you to eat. While I&rsquo;m doing that,
the three of you can go up to the loft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys entered the barn and climbed the rickety
ladder to the floor above. Crossing over to a large
pile of hay, they flung themselves down to await the
constable&rsquo;s return. It was not long before he reappeared.</p>
<p>With a sigh of intense satisfaction, Sandy reached
out for the packages Pearly had handed over and
began dividing their contents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had a good look at this man, La Qua, and the
three half-breeds,&rdquo; the policeman informed them.
&ldquo;From what little of their conversation I was able to
overhear, it is evident that they are about to leave
Wandley&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;ll probably proceed at once to
Settlement Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they follow the same trail as we will?&rdquo;
asked Dick.</p>
<p>Constable Pearly nodded. &ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s only one
route which leads off in that direction. They will
go directly past the bend in the river, where we are
to await the coming of Richardson and Rand. Our
best plan is to remain here until La Qua and his two
men leave. Then we can follow them leisurely.
As I said before, we have only a few miles to go.
I think we&rsquo;d better not take our horses with us. I&rsquo;ll
make arrangements with Wandley himself to have
them looked after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearly excused himself, and a short time later the
boys could hear his measured tread across the frozen
ground outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll keep a sharp eye on La Qua,&rdquo; decided
Sandy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine the outlaw will stay here
very long if they are really planning to set out with
the pack-train tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Constable Pearly him pretty good policeman,&rdquo;
said Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s the new man from the Peace River
detachment,&rdquo; Dick explained. &ldquo;Corporal Rand
spoke highly of him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Sandy yawned and stretched out his legs. Since
eating, it was quite apparent that he felt much better.
Eyes twinkling, he looked across at Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to feel like a new man myself.
I&rsquo;ll be ready to start any time. I honestly believe,
Dick, that I&rsquo;m going to enjoy this adventure almost
as much as I would the trip to the coast. Hope
nothing happens to prevent a change in the outlaws&rsquo;
plans to start for the pass tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything is likely to occur now,&rdquo;
responded Dick. &ldquo;La Qua seems to be very anxious
to return to Settlement Mountain. I&rsquo;ll be very much
surprised if the pack-train doesn&rsquo;t leave there soon
after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were so busily engaged in discussing the
proposed trip that they did not hear Constable Pearly
when he stole silently up the ladder and emerged to
the loft. Dick turned quickly at the policeman&rsquo;s
approach, then started in surprise. The constable&rsquo;s
face was grave, his manner a little furtive. A slight
frown had etched more deeply the lines in his forehead.
As he came over to where the three boys sat,
he raised a finger to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The two
half-breeds have gone! But that isn&rsquo;t all! Murky
Nichols rode up to the door of the trading room a
few minutes ago, and he and La Qua are conferring
now just outside. I wonder what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face fell. Here was an unlooked-for turn
of events. A feeling of disappointment swept over
him. So Murky had become alarmed and had left
Fort Good Faith as soon as he had discovered that
he, Dick, had eluded him. Was he here to instruct
La Qua not to send the pack-train of stolen fur
through the pass?</p>
<p>In as few words as possible, Dick informed Pearly
of the incidents of the previous night, describing
Murky&rsquo;s suspicious attitude when he had forced his
way into Dick&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;that Nichols has
come expressly for the purpose of warning La
Qua?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable folded his arms and stood for a
short time, his brow wrinkled in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard to guess what will be the outcome of
this visit,&rdquo; he answered finally, &ldquo;or to know definitely
Murky&rsquo;s purpose. But it is easy to see that
he came here on some matter of extreme importance.
His horse nearly dropped from exhaustion
as he rode in. Its flanks were steaming wet, spattered
with mud, while under its belly were two horrible
welts which the brute had inflicted with his
spurs. At any other time, I would have arrested
Murky on the spot for cruelty to a poor dumb animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Pearly&rsquo;s eyes flashed with indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s driven furiously all the way from Fort
Good Faith,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He would never have
done that unless the occasion warranted the effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better remain in hiding,&rdquo; trembled
Sandy. &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll be safe here, constable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ghost of a smile played across the policeman&rsquo;s
weather-tanned features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean &lsquo;safe from detection&rsquo;&mdash;I doubt it.
Sooner or later some one is certain to enter this loft
and will find you here. Murky may lead his horse
into the stable at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he does, he may not come to the loft,&rdquo;
reasoned Dick. &ldquo;There is plenty of hay piled up in
the stable below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about your ponies? Wouldn&rsquo;t he
recognize them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy gasped in unison. Toma bounded
to his feet with a guttural exclamation of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nichols be sure know ponies right away,&rdquo; he
declared excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we&rsquo;d better do?&rdquo; Sandy
quavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your horses out of the stable as quickly as
possible,&rdquo; Pearly replied. &ldquo;This young man here&rdquo;&mdash;indicating
Toma&mdash;&ldquo;can give me a hand. Come
on! We&rsquo;ll have to hurry. You two,&rdquo; motioning
Dick and Sandy to remain seated, &ldquo;will remain here.
I&rsquo;ll let you know just as soon as the coast is clear.
I may possibly find another hiding place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll take them out through the back door,&rdquo;
said Dick.</p>
<p>A noise below, followed by the creaking of a door,
indicated to the boys that Constable Pearly and
Toma were taking out the ponies. Soon after another
sound came from the front of the building.
Almost immediately, Dick heard someone walking
across the stable floor and the gruff voices of La
Qua and Nichols.</p>
<p>Although they listened intently, neither Dick nor
Sandy could hear any of the conversation. The
rumbling tones died away presently. A tense moment
had passed. Sandy rose and tip-toed across
the loft, endeavoring to peep out through a narrow
slit between the logs. He was about to turn to
come back, when he became visibly excited, motioning
frantically to his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Qua has taken out his horse!&rdquo; he whispered
breathlessly to Dick, as soon as the other had joined
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Murky going with him?&rdquo; asked Dick.</p>
<p>Sandy stepped back to permit the other to look
through the tiny aperture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;From the look of it, Murky
intends to remain here. La Qua is probably going
on to Settlement Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Dick caught sight of a fleeting roan, upon which
was astride the slouching, unkempt figure of La
Qua. Then abruptly he was startled by the sound
of the door of the stable creaking open again, and a
few moments later, heavy steps upon the ladder,
leading to the loft.</p>
<p>For one brief moment, Dick&rsquo;s heart leaped to his
throat. Had Murky Nichols learned of their presence
there? Or was it Constable Pearly and Toma?
He and Sandy stood shaking with suppressed excitement,
their eyes riveted on the trap-door. Both
breathed a sigh of relief as the flushed face of the
mounted policeman appeared through the opening.
Behind him, came Toma. Dick and Sandy rushed
forward excitedly to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think La Qua is going on to Settlement
Mountain?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<p>The constable paused to brush the dust from his
tunic. A thoughtful expression shadowed his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This thing is getting more and more complicated,&rdquo;
he finally broke forth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
to make of it. If La Qua has really gone on to
Settlement Mountain in anticipation of the trip tonight,
I can&rsquo;t understand why Nichols did not accompany
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is here to watch our movements,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;He may have heard of our arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pearly compressed his lips and looked searchingly
at the three boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any one see you when you rode up?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Sandy and Dick both shook their heads, but Toma&mdash;it
was quite apparent&mdash;had important information
to impart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see &rsquo;em two fellows walk away from compound
just when we ride up,&rdquo; came his startling revelation.
&ldquo;Me no sure, but I think mebbe one fellow
him white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they go?&rdquo; snapped Pearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the young Indian guide.
&ldquo;When we get close I see &rsquo;em no more. Mebbe
they walk around building and go in trading room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep silence followed this last statement.
Pearly regarded Dick with questioning eyes. Sandy
rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that it was La Qua and one of
the half-breeds, and that they recognized us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable made an impatient gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all conjecture and will get us nowhere.
We have no way of determining whether the outlaws
know you are here or not. The thing to do is
to assume that they haven&rsquo;t seen you, and lay our
plans accordingly. Toma and I have staked out the
ponies about a hundred yards from here in a shallow
coulee that slopes down to the shore of Settlement
House River. Your next move will be to get over
there without Murky seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will we do with the ponies now?&rdquo;
Sandy interposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. As I previously informed
you, I had intended to ask Wandley to look after
them. That is out of the question now with Nichols
here. They must remain hidden from his inquisitive
eyes&mdash;kept out of sight entirely. The only thing I
can think of just now is to take them with us to the
meeting place near the bend of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The constable paused for a brief moment before
he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please listen to me closely. I&rsquo;m going back to
the trading room and strike up an acquaintance with
our friend, Mr. Nichols. I&rsquo;ll engage him in conversation
for ten or fifteen minutes. That will give
you plenty of time to make your way to the coulee
undetected. Wait for five or six minutes after I
go before you leave the loft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get to the coulee,&rdquo; inquired Dick,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re to wait for you. Is that the understanding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded Pearly, turning to go, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rejoin
you there in half an hour. I&rsquo;ll ride my own horse
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further word, the policeman disappeared
through the opening again, much to the amusement
of Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be tired climbing up and down that ladder,&rdquo;
he grinned. &ldquo;Is this the fourth or the fifth
time he&rsquo;s been up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no joking matter,&rdquo; Dick reproved him.
&ldquo;Sandy, I&rsquo;ve left my watch at home. Have you got
yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Sandy, feeling in his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better hold it in your hand until the time comes
for us to slip away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy followed out the suggestion with alacrity.
Silence fell over the little party, a silence so deep
that Dick could have sworn that he could hear the
faint ticking of his chum&rsquo;s watch. An interminable
period seemed to have passed before Sandy raised
his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to go!&rdquo; he whispered eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE AMBUSCADE</span></h2>
<p>Toma led the way to the coulee where the ponies
were picketed. On the road thither they had met no
one, and were in consequence in high spirits as they
pushed forward through the trees, entered the draw,
and came finally to the screen of thicket beyond
which the horses munched contentedly on the dry
grass covering the space around them.</p>
<p>Dick noted with deep concern that the wind had
veered round more to the north and that the weather
had become appreciably cooler. As yet there was no
hint of a storm. Scarcely a cloud could be seen
across the blue expanse of sky.</p>
<p>Sandy drew his coat more tightly about him and
sat down in the shelter of a small thicket, while Dick
and Toma began a restless pacing back and forth in
the cleared space near the ponies. They were thus
occupied when the sound of clattering hoofs heralded
the approach of Constable Pearly.</p>
<p>A moment later he drew up in front of them,
smiling down cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we might as well start,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as you boys have saddled up, we&rsquo;ll strike
off along the Settlement River trail. We have plenty
of time and can proceed slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys hastened to obey. Presently they drew
away from the coulee, keeping well within the shelter
of spruce and jack-pine bordering the river. A few
hundred yards farther on they picked up the faint
thread of a trail, which soon brought them to the
main travelled road. Here, two abreast, Constable
Pearly and Toma in the lead, they jaunted leisurely
along.</p>
<p>Conversation lagged. For some unknown reason,
the little party rode under a cloud of dejection.
Pearly&rsquo;s face had become set and stern; Sandy
slumped in his saddle; Toma&rsquo;s eyes wandered furtively
from side to side; while Dick himself was
obsessed by a sense of foreboding. This feeling persisted
as they continued slowly on their way. Strive
as he would against it, he could not shake off the
thought of impending disaster. It was as if the
gray spectre of some great trouble followed in their
rear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Dick wondered if this unpleasant phantasm had
come as the result of his nervous strain and lack of
sleep, or if it was really a warning. Ought he to
tell Constable Pearly? Pressing his heels against
his pony&rsquo;s flanks, he cantered up behind the policeman
for the purpose of doing so, but on second
thought decided against it. Pearly would probably
laugh at him and with just cause, for his fears were
groundless. It was folly even to think about it.
He must endeavor to get a better grip of himself.</p>
<p>A moment later, he wished he had acted upon his
first impulse. The constable suddenly threw his
hands high in the air and dropped from his saddle.
The reverberating report of a rifle, a puff of smoke
from the side of the trail, the fleeting glimpse of
someone hurtling away through the underbrush&mdash;all
were vivid impressions, indelibly traced across
Dick&rsquo;s mind. With a snort of fear, his horse had
thrown himself back so abruptly that its rider had
nearly become unseated. Dick sprang to the ground
just as Toma, who had already dismounted, stooped
over Pearly&rsquo;s prostrate form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he dead!&rdquo; gasped Dick.</p>
<p>Sandy rode up, his cheeks ashen with horror, a
revolver gripped in one trembling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The half-breed!&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;The same man
who tried to stab Nichols. I saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yellow, despicable cur!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Dick placed two hands gently under
the constable&rsquo;s broad shoulders, and supporting the
wounded man&rsquo;s head against his own body, raised
the limp, but still breathing, form to a more upright
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be mortally wounded,&rdquo; he declared in a
stricken voice. &ldquo;We must do something quickly.
We&rsquo;ll have to take him back to Wandley&rsquo;s post.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Toma quickly unbuttoned the policeman&rsquo;s tunic.
A red stain colored the cloth beneath. With his
hunting knife, the young guide slit open the shirt
and undergarment, revealing the wound itself&mdash;a
dangerous one, a few inches below the right arm-pit.</p>
<p>As Dick well knew, every member of the mounted
police force was required to carry a first-aid kit.
Acting upon this knowledge, he and Toma hurriedly
went through the stricken man&rsquo;s pockets until they
discovered the object of their search. Absorbent
cotton, bandages, adhesive tape and a small bottle
of disinfectant were yanked out of the container and
placed in handy proximity. Toma began the work
of dressing the wound with the calm deliberateness
of an experienced surgeon. At the end of a few
minutes he straightened up, breathing a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe by do that we help save his life,&rdquo; he murmured
hopefully. &ldquo;Next thing&mdash;how we get him
back to Wandley&rsquo;s? Constable Pearly him too big
to tie on horse. What you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys looked from one to the other in dismay.
How indeed, was this imperative task to be accomplished.
Dick thrust his hands disconsolately in his
pockets, unable to think of any adequate plan. Sandy
dismounted and strode forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that we could place him on one
of the smaller ponies,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;and support
him by riding on either side&mdash;three horses abreast?
It seems to be the only way. We could link our
arms in his and drive carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Toma remained thoughtful for a moment,
considering Sandy&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may work,&rdquo; Dick decided. &ldquo;At any rate, we
must do something quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To raise the limp and heavy figure to the saddle
proved to be a difficult task. The ponies snorted
and swung back. Dick was almost in despair before
they finally succeeded in getting the wounded man
in place and had made a start for Wandley&rsquo;s post.
He rode on one side of the policeman and Toma on
the other. Long before they had traversed the first
few hundred yards, their arms ached from the burden.
Also some difficulty was experienced in keeping
the ponies together.</p>
<p>In places, where the trail narrowed down to a
mere foot-path, they were compelled to break the
close formation. At such times, one of the boys
would be compelled to dismount and support the
figure from the ground until the road again grew
wider.</p>
<p>Altogether, it was a sorry and dejected group that
made its way back over the selfsame route they had
come only a few minutes before. In the twinkling
of an eye, the carefully laid plans of Corporal Rand
had miscarried. Their hopes had gone glimmering.
Murky Nichols had shown his hand. One of Dick&rsquo;s
greatest worries just now was that the crafty outlaw
himself would soon witness their arrival at the post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Moving along carefully, their arms and shoulders
aching from the strain put upon them, they came at
last within sight of Wandley&rsquo;s. As they emerged
upon the small prairie, at the far side of which the
post was situated, they came directly in the path of
a sharp &ldquo;northwester.&rdquo; The smiling sky of an hour
previous had become leaden with menace. Dun,
metal-colored clouds scudded before the wind. The
horizon, black and threatening, indicated only too
plainly the approach of a storm.</p>
<p>They rode up to the door of the trading room in
a dispirited silence. A curious group gathered about
them. Anxiously, Dick scanned the unfamiliar
faces, expecting to see that of Murky Nichols. But
the outlaw was not there. Willing hands assisted
them in lifting Pearly down from his precarious seat
and help carry him within. The solicitous figure of
Wandley himself presently pushed forward through
the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu! What has happened?&rdquo; cried a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A policeman!&rdquo; gasped Wandley, his good-humored
face suddenly gray with concern. &ldquo;Who shot
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy mumbled something under his breath.
Dick turned his head and looked up appealingly into
the horrified eyes of the free trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you help us out, Mr. Wandley? Constable
Pearly&rsquo;s condition is serious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Wandley took in the situation at a glance. He
was a man of action. In an incredibly short space
he had placed a room at the policeman&rsquo;s disposal,
and in various ways assisted in making him comfortable.
A short time later, the three boys followed
Wandley to the trading room, where they told the
story of the ambuscade.</p>
<p>The free trader listened with rapt attention. A
stolid, heavy-set man, known throughout the North
for his honesty and sincerity of purpose, he showed
by his manner and expression unmistakably what
he thought of the outrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose could have been guilty of
such a dastardly attack?&rdquo; he asked at the conclusion
of the boys&rsquo; recital. &ldquo;Did you see the person who
fired the shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was about to tell Wandley of his suspicions,
when Dick silenced him with a look. Other persons
were within hearing and might carry the information
to Nichols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he lied deliberately, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t the faintest
idea. Sandy, here, thought he caught a glimpse of
a person running in the underbrush shortly after the
shot was fired. But we have no knowledge of his
identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wandley turned sympathetic eyes upon his three
informants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that everything possible is done for
Pearly,&rdquo; he promised them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sending over to
the Indian village for a native doctor who has often
proved to be very good in cases of this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys thanked the free trader and turned to go.
They still had time to reach the bend in the river
before the coming of Sergeant Richardson and Corporal
Rand. Their own ponies were waiting outside.
At the door, moved by a sudden impulse, Dick
pressed Sandy&rsquo;s arm significantly, then hurried back
to Wandley&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have a word with you for a moment?&rdquo;
he inquired meaningly.</p>
<p>The free trader started back in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why certainly. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motioning the other to follow, he led the way to
an inner room, which served as Wandley&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&rsquo;s the trouble, my boy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Dick stood awkwardly, cap in hand, a little confused,
a little doubtful whether, after all, it would be
good policy to ask the question now uppermost in
his mind. Wandley seemed to sense the young
man&rsquo;s difficulty. He patted Dick&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak up, if it is anything of
importance,&rdquo; he said reassuringly. &ldquo;You can trust
me absolutely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick smiled across at the grizzled, earnest face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Wandley, there is something I
want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Murky Nichols here an hour or two
ago, when he arrived here at the post?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Wandley unhesitatingly replied. &ldquo;He rode
in here like a dozen furies shortly after one o&rsquo;clock.
But he&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s really gone?&rdquo; Dick breathed a sigh of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the free trader, wondering what
his young interrogator was driving at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long since he left?&rdquo; came the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than fifteen or twenty minutes ago.
He was hardly out of sight before you came in with
Pearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which trail did he take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one to Fort Good Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stepped forward and pressed the huge hand
of the free trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much. I&rsquo;ll explain sometime,
Mr. Wandley, but I&rsquo;ll have to hurry now. We&rsquo;ll
stop in to see you on our return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying which, Dick hurried through the door,
crossed the trading room and quickly rejoined his
two friends outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">THE MEETING PLACE</span></h2>
<p>Faint flecks of snow were falling as they took the
first turn in the trail at top speed. The wind had
increased in velocity. It had become a gale that bent
the tops of the spruce and poplar, driving down a
fine icy sleet through the trees. Toma raised
anxious eyes to the lowering sky and presently
shrieked out above the roar of the approaching
storm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big blizzard come pretty soon. How far we go
before we get to bend in river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a short distance,&rdquo; Dick answered, yelling
at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>At a brisk canter, they passed the place of the
recent ambuscade, soon afterward following the
trail across an open meadow in the very teeth of the
storm. For a moment a white, driving curtain of
snow almost suffocated them. Only with difficulty
could they drive their ponies into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re licked!&rdquo; shouted Sandy. &ldquo;I dread to think
of waiting for anyone in this blizzard. The pack-train
will never be able to start tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>When they had gained the woodland again, it was
almost impossible to make out their surroundings
clearly. Overhead was a gray impenetrable blur.
Within the shelter of the trees, when Dick, straining
his eyes against the whirling particles of snow, endeavored
to get his bearings, he could see scarcely
fifty yards ahead. Somewhere off to the right was
Settlement House River. Judging from the distance
they had already come, they must be close to their
destination right now.</p>
<p>Dick drew up his horse sharply, calling a halt.
His two chums came closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve gone far enough,&rdquo; was Sandy&rsquo;s
opinion, as they sat huddled on their tired mounts,
looking into each other&rsquo;s apprehensive eyes. &ldquo;My
suggestion is to leave the trail here and strike off to
the right in the direction of the river. What do you
think, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide did not immediately reply. His face
was calm and expressionless. There was no outward
manifestation of his secret, inner emotions. Just
then he was not thinking of the bend in the river at
all. Indeed, he had become so absorbed in his own
thoughts that he was scarcely conscious even of the
presence of his two companions. At that particular
moment his mind was concentrated on a matter of extreme
importance. He gazed sombrely at the trail at
their feet, across which, plainly visible in the freshly
fallen snow, were the imprints of moccasined feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Only a few minutes before someone had passed
that way. The quick mind of the guide reverted to
the shooting of Constable Pearly. From ambush, a
man had deliberately shot down the mounted policeman.
Were these tracks, which he saw now, made
by that selfsame man? Was the half-breed planning
a second attack?</p>
<p>Toma did not wish to alarm Dick and Sandy needlessly.
Yet he was possessed of a feeling&mdash;intuitive
perhaps&mdash;that the near presence of the man boded
no good to them. If it was the same person who
had wounded Constable Pearly, it was reasonable to
suppose that he would not hesitate to draw a gun
upon them.</p>
<p>It was a predicament indeed&mdash;and one fraught
with danger. The footprints led away in the same
direction that Sandy now proposed to go. It would
be foolhardy for the three of them to take a chance.
Turning the problem over and over in his mind,
Toma came to a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use all three ride over an&rsquo; try find &rsquo;em place
where we meet Sergeant Richardson. What you say
I go alone? Sandy, you Dick stay here in shelter of
bush. No take &rsquo;em me very long. If I find bend,
I come back pretty quick an&rsquo; let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young guide&rsquo;s proposal did not meet with the
instant approval that he had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; growled Sandy, &ldquo;we can all go. What&rsquo;s
the use of staying here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Toma,&rdquo; interposed Dick, &ldquo;three pairs
of eyes are better than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma scowled. He feigned an angry indifference.
&ldquo;All right. I do what you say. I think you &rsquo;fraid
mebbe poor Toma get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy reached up and snapped off the brittle twig
from a branch just over his head. He regarded it
reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Let him have his own way, Dick. If
he insists, I don&rsquo;t mind in the least. I&rsquo;m going to
crawl off this old nag of mine and stretch my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if the matter were already settled, Sandy
scrambled off his mount and led it over to a thick
clump of bushes, which offered better protection
from the storm. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Dick
followed his example. The two crouched there while
Toma sprang to the ground, tied his horse to a
young sapling and then struck off sharply to the
right on foot. In a few seconds he became lost to
view.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy brushed away the snow from a
small space in front of them and sat down, weary
and disheartened. The ponies turned with their
backs to the wind. Dick was so sleepy and tired
from his long hours of wakefulness that he had
scarcely sat down when his head began to nod, and
soon after he drowsed off completely. How long
he slept he did not know. He was awakened by the
hand of his chum, clawing roughly, excitedly at his
shoulder. He opened his eyes to look into the startled
face of his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it?&rdquo; gasped Sandy.</p>
<p>Bewildered from sleep, Dick could not imagine
what sound Sandy alluded to, when abruptly there
came to his ears the faint report of a rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys jumped to their feet, gazing fearfully
out through the storm. They trembled at the
thought of what might now have happened. They
stood shivering in the teeth of the icy gale, their
faces gray with apprehension. After a time, following
the first shock, Dick turned to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It frightened me at first,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;Thought it was the half-breed. For a moment, I
didn&rsquo;t think about Toma. He probably saw a moose
or bear and fired at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was not so sure. He shook his head doggedly,
staring gloomily away in the direction of the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better investigate, Dick,&rdquo; he trembled.
&ldquo;Even if Toma did see a moose, I doubt very much
whether he would have taken a shot at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hunting instinct in every Indian is strong,&rdquo;
argued his chum. &ldquo;Even you or I would have been
liable to act the same under similar circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Sandy was not convinced. With his moccasined
feet he kicked at a drift of freshly fallen snow.
Nervously, his hand played with the holster at his
belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m foolish, but I can&rsquo;t help thinking
that something has gone wrong. The sound we just
heard, although fainter, was very much like the one
we heard this afternoon when Pearly was wounded.
Besides, if I remember correctly, Toma has no rifle.
All he has in the way of firearms is a small automatic,
which could not possibly make as much noise
as we heard just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s face became sober again. He looked at
Sandy in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all of us had rifles strapped to our saddles
when we set out from Fort Good Faith,&rdquo; he pointed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I&mdash;but not Toma! When Toma and I
went out on our hunting trip a few days ago, he
broke the trigger-spring on his gun, and yesterday,
when we returned, he left it at the Indian village to
be repaired. When you wakened us last night, I
had my rifle in my room. Toma had none. I know
I&rsquo;m right about this, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the other&rsquo;s turn to become alarmed. With
an excited exclamation he stepped forward, and
with fumbling fingers began to remove his own rifle
from the saddle. Sandy followed suit. Without
further preliminary, they hurried to the rescue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Shoulders hunched, faces wet with melting snow,
they darted forward through the underbrush. Dick&rsquo;s
heart was beating miserably at the thought of this
new danger. Had Toma also been waylaid&mdash;probably
murdered? Desperately, he stared ahead, expecting
momentarily to find the crumpled figure of
the young guide lying in the snow. They progressed
farther and farther away from the trail. Sandy&rsquo;s
breath came in choking gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma! Toma!&rdquo; he kept repeating.</p>
<p>Presently their hopes mounted. Thus far they
had found nothing. Perhaps the young Indian was
still alive. Perhaps in some miraculous way he had
escaped the half-breed&rsquo;s death-dealing bullets.</p>
<p>Through the blinding snow-mist directly ahead,
they made out the vague outline of Settlement House
River. Toma&rsquo;s tracks had become obliterated here.
They had emerged upon an open space across which
the wind had full sweep. They would be unable
now to track Toma down. If they found him at all,
it would be through some lucky chance, rather than
through any direct effort on their part. Fifty yards
ahead, standing like a huge sentinel, guarding the
descent to the river, the boys discerned a large jack-pine.</p>
<p>Toward it they made their way, reached it after a
short interval, and glanced down along the slope
expectantly. But there was no sign of anyone. The
storm now had reached its height. Snow and sleet
lashed across the earth. Trees bent their heads before
the furious blast. Both Dick and Sandy had
seen many blizzards, but never such a one as this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Sandy took Dick&rsquo;s arm and shouted above the
roar of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in standing here, Dick. We may miss
Toma altogether. If he&rsquo;s alive, he&rsquo;s probably back
to the trail by this time. Come on! Let&rsquo;s hurry
over there ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a last look along the slope, Dick was about
to turn, when he saw the dim outline of something
just ahead. Straining his eyes, one hand shielding
his face from the driving snow, he made out, at
length, what was unmistakably the figure of a man.
Could it be Toma? The man was afoot. Quickly,
Dick started back, overcome by sudden fear. It was
the half-breed&mdash;and he carried a rifle!</p>
<p>Springing forward down the slope, Dick pulled
Sandy after him. Just ahead, a thick screen of
bushes&mdash;now weighted down with snow&mdash;would
hide them from view. Yet here it would still be possible
to watch the movements of the figure proceeding
toward them on the level ground above the slope.</p>
<p>Sandy removed his parka and glared back toward
the spot Dick had indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The half-breed!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;The
same man who shot Constable Pearly. What do
you suppose has happened to Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Rifle in hand, the half-breed came on, looking furtively
to the right and left. He seemed oblivious to
the storm. In a few moments he had approached to
within fifty feet of the place where the boys lay concealed.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Dick and Sandy reached for their
revolvers. But before they could be drawn from
their holsters, the half-breed accomplished an incredible
and surprising movement. His head went back
with a jerk&mdash;so suddenly that he nearly lost his balance.
For a moment he stood stock still, then leaped
for the protecting trunk of a poplar. Above the
roaring of the wind and storm, the boys heard distinctly
the sound of a muffled report.</p>
<p>The boys rose to their feet with a cry of joy.
Well they knew the meaning of the half-breed&rsquo;s
actions and the sound they had heard. Toma was
still alive! Not only that&mdash;he was carrying on a
sort of running fight with the outlaw. Sandy flourished
his own gun, and, had Dick not prevented it,
would have fired point-blank at the figure, which,
though sheltered from Toma&rsquo;s fire by the poplar,
offered a splendid target for the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Sandy!&rdquo; remonstrated Dick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do
that. Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forgotten Constable Pearly,&rdquo; Sandy retorted
angrily. &ldquo;The fellow deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly he does. But it&rsquo;s not your place to
retaliate. Toma is well able to look after himself.
If I&rsquo;m not mistaken the outlaw will be ready and
willing to take to his heels before long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Toma may be wounded,&rdquo; argued Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. If he is, it&rsquo;s only slightly. Our best
plan is to stay here and await developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more shots from Toma&rsquo;s automatic drove
the half-breed from his inadequate barricade. The
stocky figure suddenly lurched backward, one hand
grasping his arm. His rifle dropped to the ground.
For a split-second his face was distorted with pain.
Then, turning swiftly, he retrieved his weapon and
sped toward the slope, gaining its shelter without
sustaining further injury. The boys watched him as
he scrambled down through the trees and underbrush
in the direction of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dick!&rdquo; Sandy shouted excitedly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go over and see Toma. That&rsquo;s what I call
marksmanship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking a chance if you do. In this storm
Toma wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell whether it was you or
the half-breed. Good way to commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I won&rsquo;t take a chance,&rdquo; grinned Sandy.
&ldquo;But how are we going to join him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better slip along the slope for a few
hundred yards, then circle back to the trail where
the ponies are,&rdquo; was Dick&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The two friends proceeded to put this plan into
execution. In high spirits again, now that they knew
that the guide was safe, they hurried along, and in
less than twenty minutes were back at the same place
they had left but a short time before. They had
scarcely taken up their former position beside the
ponies, when a sharp crackling in the underbrush
close at hand, told them that Toma had returned.
He sauntered up as if nothing had happened, his
face as inscrutable and expressionless as ever.</p>
<p>Secretly, Sandy poked Dick in the ribs. Then he
turned upon the newcomer scowling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all this time?&rdquo; he demanded
hotly. &ldquo;Did it take you nearly an hour to
walk over to the river? We&rsquo;ve been sitting here so
long that we&rsquo;re nearly frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma offered no explanation. He strode over
and pulled the blanket from his pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe we find bend little farther on. Me no
think it very far now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy winked at each other as they got
once more into the saddle and followed Toma along
the drifting trail. For a time they rode on in silence,
once more conscious of the fury of the storm.
Abruptly, the trail swung to the south and very soon
they could see the broken, snow-covered valley of the
river&mdash;so close that it seemed as if the trail ran into
it. Here was the bend at last!</p>
<p>Dick recalled that Corporal Rand had instructed
him to descend to the floor of the valley and make
camp close to the river. They proceeded to do this,
first dismounting and leading the ponies after them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>A short time later they had gained their objective.
The ground was level here, densely overgrown with
trees and shrubs. The river had not yet frozen over.
Slush ice choked the current, making a grinding,
roaring sound as it floated swiftly past. Here and
there on the sandbars, large piles of ice and driftwood
had been shoved ashore. In another twenty-four
hours, with the steadily falling temperature, the
stream would be frozen over, although it would be
many days before it would be safe to cross on foot.</p>
<p>As he gathered driftwood for the fire, Dick&rsquo;s gaze
returned again and again to the ice-choked current.
A thought suddenly came to him. Sergeant Richardson
and Corporal Rand were to meet them here
at nightfall. The two were travelling westward, and
it would be necessary for them to cross the river here
before they could go on to the cabin of the outlaws at
Settlement Mountain.</p>
<p>Would they be able to do it? He looked out
again across the grinding, grating field of ice and
slowly shook his head. It was a feat he had no
desire to attempt himself. It seemed foolhardy
even to think of it. Not only would a raft be in
imminent danger of being broken to pieces by the
drifting chunks of ice in the whirling current, but
there was also the possibility of its occupants being
shaken or thrown precipitately into the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>He consulted his watch. It was now nearly four
o&rsquo;clock. The short afternoon would soon be terminated
by the approach of darkness. Night would
descend, and he shuddered to think of any attempt
on the part of the police party to cross.</p>
<p>When the flames from their campfire had commenced
to leap up, radiating warmth and comfort in
a wide circle around them, he broached the subject
to Sandy and Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;ll ever manage to get over.
It&rsquo;s getting late now. By the time they&rsquo;ve built a
raft, it will be so dark that it will be out of the question
to think of crossing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe him Corporal Rand know about raft
somewhere on other side of river,&rdquo; said Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never mentioned it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, who had been sitting on the end of a fallen
tree, gazing thoughtfully into the fire, looked up with
a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can trust Rand and Richardson to do the
impossible,&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to lay you a
wager that if they reach the opposite side of the river
tonight, they&rsquo;ll manage somehow to find a way to
get across. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll come floating over on
one of those huge cakes of ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take your bet, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick laughed.
&ldquo;Just the same I&rsquo;d hate to be in their shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Toma rose and walked down to the edge of the
river, returning a moment later with water for tea.
Huddled around the blaze, they ate from the supplies
that had been purchased at Wandley&rsquo;s post. Darkness
was quickly descending. As is frequently the
case in the North, the wind subsided as night approached;
but the snow continued to fall. If possible,
it came down thicker than ever. About them
was one all-enveloping mantle of white. Even the
trees and underbrush bent under the weight of their
snowy burden.</p>
<p>The three ponies, warmly blanketed, each one tied
to a long picket-rope, pawed away the snow in order
to browse at the dead grass and moss underneath.
Dick felt sorry for the little beasts, almost wishing
that he had left them with Constable Pearly&rsquo;s horse
at Wandley&rsquo;s. While he was watching them, Toma
broke forth abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three rose swiftly to their feet and rushed
down to the shore of the river. Again came the
sound&mdash;a faint halloo which trembled across the valley.
The boys cupped their hands to their mouths
and sent back an answering shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police party! What did I tell you, Dick?
They&rsquo;ll make it yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Sandy reached out and slapped Dick
excitedly on the shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">THE FIRST PRISONER</span></h2>
<p>Swinging their arms against their bodies, and
walking up and down along the river bank, from
time to time the boys shouted out words of encouragement.
Time dragged monotonously. Hours
seemed to have passed before they heard again from
the mounted policemen.</p>
<p>Faintly at first, then louder as it approached, they
heard the scraping of the raft. Human voices
sounded eerily out of the gloom. A thrill of excitement
coursed along Dick&rsquo;s spine. The suspense was
nerve-breaking. He had become almost as limp as
a rag, when finally he discerned a dark shape ahead
and the raft pushed in closer to shore. A few minutes
later, using the long poles which had served
them so well in crossing, Sergeant Richardson and
Corporal Rand vaulted across the intervening space
separating them from the beach.</p>
<p>It was a happy re-union. The three boys had not
seen Sergeant Richardson for months. They wrung
the policeman&rsquo;s hand, then escorted him and his companion
back to the campfire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pearly?&rdquo; demanded Corporal Rand,
looking about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wounded,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a terrible
time, corporal. Murky Nichols followed us to
Wandley&rsquo;s post, where he conferred with La Qua.
La Qua went on to Settlement Mountain alone, first
sending ahead the two half-breeds who were with
him. While Pearly and the three of us were journeying
along the trail on the way here, Pearly was
shot down from ambush. We were compelled to
take him back to Wandley&rsquo;s. The man who shot
him was the same person you arrested yesterday&mdash;the
one who attempted to stab Nichols. He&rsquo;s in this
vicinity right now. Less than two hours ago, when
Toma was reconnoitering in an effort to find this
place, he fired at him several times. Toma managed
to escape injury and made things so hot for him that
he was compelled to seek shelter along the slope of
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young guide&rsquo;s eyes had widened perceptibly
and he stared unbelievingly at his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you find out about that?&rdquo; he blurted.</p>
<p>Sergeant Richardson ignored the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Murky Nichols see you when you left Fort
Good Faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick flushed under the searching scrutiny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he saw us, but he found out about
our departure right after we left.&rdquo; Then Dick
turned to Corporal Rand. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t altogether
my fault, corporal. In less than ten minutes after
you went out of my room, the door opened and
Murky Nichols came in. He seemed suspicious and
asked me what I was doing up at that hour. I
pleaded a toothache and was finally forced to ask
him to leave. He took up a position in the hall outside.
It was easy to see that he did not believe my
story and intended to watch me. I was compelled
to slip out of the window and go around and wake
Sandy and Toma. We were very quiet and I do not
believe that he had any intimation of the trick we
had played upon him until an hour or two after
we&rsquo;d gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Richardson nor Rand had anything to
say. Dick felt that their silence was in itself condemnatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did the very best I could.&rdquo; His voice shook a
little. &ldquo;Corporal Rand, I endeavored to follow out
your instructions. If I have spoiled your plan, I&rsquo;m
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned his head to hide the tears which had
suddenly welled into his eyes. Then he felt a strong
comforting hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Dick. It&rsquo;s not your fault,&rdquo; Corporal
Rand declared consolingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all done remarkably well,&rdquo; Sergeant
Richardson congratulated them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you.
In the person of Murky Nichols we have one of the
cleverest, shrewdest outlaws in this North country.
He was your opponent today. You must remember
that. He&rsquo;s not very easily outwitted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;How badly is Pearly wounded?&rdquo; asked Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite seriously, I think,&rdquo; Sandy answered. &ldquo;He
was unconscious and lost a good deal of blood before
we could get him back to the post. Wandley is
doing all that is possible for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to push on to Settlement Mountain
tonight?&rdquo; Dick inquired, addressing Sergeant
Richardson. &ldquo;Or do you think that no attempt will
be made to start for the pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say. Personally, I&rsquo;m inclined to believe
that they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this storm!&rdquo; gasped Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if that will make a great deal of difference.
I&rsquo;m convinced now that they have a huge
cache in their cabin at Settlement Mountain. They&rsquo;ll
be compelled to do one of two things&mdash;either remove
their fur to another place of safety, or follow their
original plan to take it through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass.
They&rsquo;ll be forced to act quickly. They&rsquo;re in a difficult
predicament and know it. From what you have
already told me, it is easy to see what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were hanging upon the sergeant&rsquo;s
words. He had ceased speaking for a moment and
had stepped closer to the fire, his handsome upright
figure outlined clearly against the background beyond.
Corporal Rand addressed his superior:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all clear enough,&rdquo; Richardson spoke again.
&ldquo;Nichols&rsquo; suspicions have become aroused. When
he found out that you three boys had left Fort Good
Faith and had started north for Wandley&rsquo;s, he surmised
at once what was afoot. Arriving at Wandley&rsquo;s
and finding Pearly there, very naturally still
further alarmed him. Fortunately for him, his confederate,
La Qua, had not yet gone on to Settlement
Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now put yourself in his place,&rdquo; he went on after
a short pause. &ldquo;What was to be done? A cache of
stolen fur worth thousands of dollars in a cabin only
a few miles away awaiting shipment&mdash;and the police
aware of this fact! He would suppose naturally that
Pearly intended to go immediately to seize the cache.
In desperation, he ordered La Qua to send the two
half-breeds ahead with instructions to ambush the
police party. La Qua himself hurried on to Settlement
Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theory seems reasonable enough,&rdquo; said Corporal
Rand. &ldquo;But now that the outlaws know that
Pearly is out of the way, do you suppose that they
will do anything tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Qua doesn&rsquo;t know this. Even if he did, it
would be folly on his part to take chances. Something
must be done with the cache at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you really intend to start?&rdquo; asked Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Right away. Neither the corporal nor
myself have had anything to eat since this noon, but
we dare not stop now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma, who had gone out to gather brush for the
fire, suddenly darted back within the circle of light,
a startled cry on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;Get to cover! I jus&rsquo; see
&rsquo;em someone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s warning came in the nick of time. Motioning
to the boys to drop back away from the
campfire, Sergeant Richardson and Corporal Rand
struck off hurriedly. With Sandy at his side, Dick
found himself a moment later stumbling through
snow more than ankle-deep. They could hear the
sound of hurrying forms, a sharp word of command&mdash;then
silence! They brought up before a willow
copse, thick and almost impassable. Here they
crouched low, waiting developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the half-breed again,&rdquo; Dick whispered
hoarsely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing we scattered when we
did. Anyone near the campfire would make a splendid
target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked back toward the place they
had just vacated. A bright glare of firelight cast its
reflection through a wide circle of pitchy darkness,
producing an eerie effect. The trees looked stark
and gaunt at the outer fringe of the circle. The
place, which a few moments before had been alive
with the human forms of his companions, was now
totally deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>They waited breathlessly. The commotion, following
Toma&rsquo;s announcement, had died away. Deep
and forbidding seemed the solitude of the forest.
Dick wondered what had become of the two policemen
and Toma. He half expected to hear the disconcerting
crack of a revolver. The minutes passed
slowly. The snow fell softly now&mdash;huge white flakes
floating through the air like particles of fluff. Sandy
stamped his feet impatiently, then pulled his parka
farther down so that it muffled his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t one thing, it&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; he lamented.
&ldquo;If that half-breed has come back to bother us, he
may get more than he has bargained for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked up sharply. A sudden tramping of
feet and the crackling of underbrush, warned him of
someone&rsquo;s approach. For a split-second his heart
caught with excitement. Was the half-breed himself
coming their way? Then his mouth gaped open in
amazement. Within the circle of light there appeared
abruptly three forms, two of which the boys
quickly recognized&mdash;Richardson and Rand. They
half-carried, half-dragged between them a struggling
protesting creature&mdash;none other than the half-breed
himself!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The boys hurried forward. As they came up to
where the policemen and their prisoner stood, they
observed that the half-breed&rsquo;s wrists had been manacled.
Over his prominent cheekbone, close to his
left eye, was a large welt he had received in his
encounter with the guardians of the law. Corporal
Rand&rsquo;s uniform was slightly dishevelled. A button
had been torn from his coat. He was bleeding from
a cut on one cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one of Murky&rsquo;s friends that won&rsquo;t give us
so much trouble in the future,&rdquo; Sergeant Richardson
stated evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not be released this time either,&rdquo; the corporal
said with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage to capture him so quickly?&rdquo;
Sandy inquired wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept him occupied,&rdquo; the sergeant replied, &ldquo;while
Corporal Rand stole up on him from behind. Rand
got him after a short struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take him along with us, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; Rand answered. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t
we better start, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richardson brushed the snow from his fur jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. At once. Dick,&rdquo; he instructed, &ldquo;you can
saddle your ponies right away. We&rsquo;ll use them in
breaking trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys offered the two policemen the use of
their mounts but the offer was rejected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be tired enough as it is,&rdquo; Corporal Rand
pointed out. &ldquo;Dick here hasn&rsquo;t had a wink of sleep
in the past twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The party set out shortly afterward, moving
quickly through the darkness. They reached the
Settlement River trail without mishap. Not a word
was spoken. Silently they trekked on. In spite of
the importance of their undertaking, the travelling
had become so monotonous that Dick nodded in the
saddle. The crunch, crunch, crunch of the ponies&rsquo;
hoofs was slowly lulling him to sleep. Had his horse
not stumbled occasionally over some obstruction in
the trail, it is probable he might have fallen from
his seat. On one of these occasions, shaken back to
consciousness when on the verge of dropping off into
sound sleep, he heard the voice of Sergeant Richardson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, boys, until I get my bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They checked their forward progress at once.
Instructing Sandy to look after the prisoner, the two
policemen came up to the head of the column, conversing
in low tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We leave the trail here somewhere,&rdquo; Richardson
announced. &ldquo;There used to be a tiny foot-path that
wound away through the trees to our left. This is
the one the outlaws must use in going to and from
Settlement Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like hunting for a needle in a haystack,&rdquo; Dick
heard Rand remark. &ldquo;Have you a flashlight, sergeant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint flicker of light appeared and the two men
started up the trail, their eyes searching the ground.
Dick would have pushed on after them but Toma,
who was in the lead, restrained him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;They want us to stay here,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Come back jus&rsquo; so soon find &rsquo;em pack-trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curious eyes of the boys followed the retreating
figures. Now and again, like a large fire-fly,
the small electric torch flashed out. It appeared,
disappeared, re-appeared, lending reality to the illusion.</p>
<p>How long they watched there, Dick could not say.
He was nodding again when the two returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found it,&rdquo; said Sergeant Richardson. &ldquo;Follow
us. Sandy, keep a good watch of the prisoner.&rdquo;
The party came to a halt again at the juncture of
the two trails. The one which threaded its way on
their left, led more or less directly to Settlement
Mountain.</p>
<p>They were now only a mile from their objective.
A thrill of suppressed excitement permeated each
member of the party. Dick shook off his drowsiness
and now sat alert, every sense keyed to the highest
pitch. The policemen continued in the lead, walking
forward at a brisk rate. Toma half-swung in the
saddle and asked Dick in a subdued whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we find &rsquo;em outlaws pretty soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick answered hesitatingly: &ldquo;Yes, I think so,
Toma. It isn&rsquo;t very far now. Too bad you haven&rsquo;t
your rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>A sudden commotion behind drew their attention.
Sandy cried out in a tremulous voice as he slid from
the saddle. A moment later he was rushing wildly
away through the darkness. The snapping of dry
branches, the crackling of underbrush was succeeded
by a weird, unearthly shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoner has escaped!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed
breathlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">AN UNEXPECTED SETBACK</span></h2>
<p>Guided by the sound at the side of the trail, Dick
bounded forward to Sandy&rsquo;s assistance. In his excitement,
he ran straight into a small sapling with a
force that shook the breath from his body. Dazed,
he struck forward again, tearing his face and hands
in a thicket of saskatoon. Desperately, he struggled
on.</p>
<p>Faintly outlined in the gloom ahead, he saw two
struggling forms. He drove straight toward them,
striking Sandy&rsquo;s opponent with a jarring impact.
The three went to the ground in a squirming heap.
The half-breed, who was fighting for his life, struck
out with arms and legs like a madman. As Dick&rsquo;s
unguarded left arm swung across his adversary&rsquo;s
face, the outlaw sank his teeth into it, hanging there
very much after the manner of a bull dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>A blow in the pit of Sandy&rsquo;s stomach had put that
young man temporarily out of commission. He lay
groaning a few feet away. It was this sound&mdash;more
than the excruciating pain he suffered himself&mdash;that
finally induced Dick to shake his arm free and
scramble dizzily to his knees. But he got no further.
The half-breed&rsquo;s manacled wrists brought down
with all the strength and force of which he was
capable, transferred the temporary advantage. Dick
sat down with a grunt, many brilliant, multi-colored
lights popping before his eyes.</p>
<p>The outlaw pushed himself back, turned on his
side and rose hastily to his feet. He had gone only
a few yards, however, when Dick, somewhat recovered
from the effects of the blow, sprang up in hot
pursuit. The race was of short duration. A few
moments later, Dick had seized the stocky runner by
the nape of the neck and had jerked him to a sudden
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll be ready to go back now,&rdquo; gritted
Dick. &ldquo;Any more of your funny tricks and I won&rsquo;t
be responsible for what happens. Come on, now&mdash;get
going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy joined them a moment later. With the
prisoner between them, they soon reached the trail.
Toma and the two policemen came hurrying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he didn&rsquo;t get away after all!&rdquo; Sergeant Richardson
exclaimed thankfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad of
that. But it&rsquo;s my own fault. I should have known
better than to give him this chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either one of you hurt?&rdquo; Rand inquired
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;We were shaken up a bit&mdash;all
of us. But we&rsquo;re ready to go on now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Rand will take charge of the prisoner,&rdquo;
Richardson instructed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead the way alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed on again, following closely and
silently the tall figure of the police sergeant. Without
incident, they travelled another quarter of a mile.
Each minute was bringing them closer and closer to
the outlaws&rsquo; encampment. Unknown dangers lay
ahead. Dick&rsquo;s heart beat quickly at the thought of
what might presently transpire.</p>
<p>A short time afterward Richardson called a halt.
He hurried back to confer with Corporal Rand.
Then he came forward to where Dick sat and announced
briefly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settlement Mountain just ahead. Two hundred
yards from the outlaws&rsquo; cabin. Dismount quickly,
tie your horses somewhere near here in the underbrush.
Then come back for further orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three boys complied hastily. When they returned,
the sergeant spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Rand and I are going forward to investigate.
We&rsquo;ll leave the prisoner here with you.
Under no circumstances are any of you to follow us.
Remain here. We&rsquo;ll be back as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another long wait. The boys stared out fearfully
through the darkness. Their pulses pounded with
excitement. Impatiently, they paced back and forth,
scarcely able to endure the suspense. When finally
they heard footsteps approaching, they breathed relievedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>It was Corporal Rand. He too was excited.
When he spoke, his voice was husky with some deep
emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richardson&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>It was a verbal thunderbolt. The boys jumped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Dick and Sandy gasped out in
unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone, I tell you!&rdquo; Rand whispered hoarsely.
&ldquo;Gone as completely as if the earth had swallowed
him up. I think they&rsquo;ve got him. We were walking
along&mdash;the sergeant about thirty feet in advance of
me&mdash;when the thing happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed incredible. A feeling of horror swept
over Dick, while Sandy stood, shaking like a leaf.
A poignant, miserable silence ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but di&mdash;did you look for him?&rdquo; stammered
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I looked everywhere. In the darkness, I
could see nothing. I dare not call out for fear the
outlaws might be close at hand. Richardson probably
walked straight into the arms of one of La
Qua&rsquo;s sentries, was struck over the head and then
dumped bodily into some thicket. It was a good
thing for me that Richardson had the flashlight. I
think I would have been tempted to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy had recovered the use of his vocal organs
and now poured out his plaint&mdash;a sort of wail that
rang softly through the forest&rsquo;s stillness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;First Pearly and now Richardson!&rdquo; groaned
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; Rand attempted to comfort
them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard blow, I&rsquo;ll admit, but we&rsquo;ll contrive
to get out of this scrape somehow. You boys
will have to help me. I must rely on you. I can&rsquo;t
very well go on with this thing alone. Are you
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are!&rdquo; Dick and Sandy sang out in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet! Fight &rsquo;em all same like mad wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit. The first thing to do is to find
out what has become of Richardson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The five minutes which passed before Rand spoke
again seemed like an eternity to the three young adventurers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy will stay here with the prisoner and the
ponies. If he attempts another break for liberty,
shoot him on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trembling young Scotchman made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear me, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do as I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now&mdash;with regard to my plan: With
the exception of Toma, we&rsquo;re all heavily armed.
Toma, you will take the half-breed&rsquo;s rifle. The three
of us will set out at once for the outlaws&rsquo; cabin,
which is situated about two hundred yards straight
ahead of us. Toma will circle around to the left,
Dick to the right, while I will proceed directly along
this trail to the place where Richardson disappeared.
Neither one of you will fire a shot unless cornered&mdash;or
in self-defense. What I want to do first of all is
to try to find Richardson. If he hasn&rsquo;t been taken
to the cabin, he won&rsquo;t be very far from the place I
saw him last. Naturally, he&rsquo;ll be heavily guarded.
In some way we must secure his release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand ceased speaking. An unearthly hush had
settled around them. Dick was shaking as if from
the ague. Terror gripped him. Thankful he was
that the darkness shadowed his face. He realized
that his cheeks must be ghastly white. In spite of
the cold, drops of moisture had gathered on his forehead.
He seemed to be burning up. Like Sandy,
he had temporarily lost the use of his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any questions to ask?&rdquo; tersed Rand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-n&mdash;no,&rdquo; Dick heard himself stammering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, we&rsquo;ll start. Remember&mdash;no
shooting unless it is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated forthwith. Almost immediately
Dick was on his way. He moved cautiously and
very slowly. His terror, the choking fear of a few
moments ago, had gone. It was relief to move his
limbs. He had become himself once more, determined
to give the very best he had&mdash;to meet danger
calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Off to his left he saw the twinkling lights of the
cabin. He was getting closer now; he must be still
more careful, more deliberate in his movements.
Perhaps the faintest sound would betray him.</p>
<p>Haunting the deepest shadows, he stole furtively
along, treading softly through the snow&mdash;crouching
here&mdash;hurrying forward there; in one place, that
seemed more exposed to view, creeping forward on
hands and knees.</p>
<p>He brought up suddenly, so startled that he nearly
emitted a shriek. He stood perfectly still, his breath
catching in his throat. Straight ahead, scarcely ten
feet away, he saw the silhouette of one of La Qua&rsquo;s
sentries. The man was alone, a rifle slung carelessly
over the crook of his left arm. He paced
silently back and forth, occasionally turning his head
in the direction of the cabin.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s deliberation, Dick decided to
steal past the sentry. At all cost, he must go on to
the cabin. Inch at a time, he wormed his way ahead,
contriving to keep a screen of underbrush between
him and his enemy. Once the sharp crackling of a
twig caused his heart to leap in apprehension. His
hands shook. His breath seemed to burn in his
throat. Instinct told him to turn precipitously and
take to his heels. With difficulty was he able to steel
himself for the ordeal. He was so close to the
sentry now that he actually believed he could hear
the man&rsquo;s deep breathing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>For one tense moment he waited, shrinking back
in the shadows, not daring to move. The sentry had
turned his head and was looking straight in his direction.
Dick thought that he could see the other&rsquo;s
eyes, shining like those of a cat in the darkness.
Then abruptly his heart almost stopped beating. For
the first time he became aware of another presence.
He perceived now the reason why he had not
previously seen the second outlaw. This person,
short in stature&mdash;unmistakably an Indian&mdash;had
stood with his back against a large spruce, seeming
to form a part of the trunk of the tree. But he had
stepped forward now, his body limned in the half-light,
and had stolen over to the right, disappearing
behind the thicket in which Dick himself stood concealed.</p>
<p>Dick was fully conscious of the peril of his position.
The Indian was probably stalking him, as a
tiger stalks its prey. Not a moment was to be lost.
He placed one foot gingerly in front of him and
started away, quickening his pace after he had placed
a few yards between himself and the sentry. A very
much frightened and trembling young man moved
out to the edge of the clearing which encircled the
cabin.</p>
<p>What ought he to do now?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE OUTLAWS&rsquo; CABIN</span></h2>
<p>He could hear voices now and the hurried trampling
of feet. Once a husky howled. From the open
door of another building&mdash;evidently a stable&mdash;there
flickered the light of several lanterns. The stable,
about fifty yards on the north side of the house, was
the center of unusual activity. Here men called to
each other in guttural Cree amid the confusion of
barking dogs and the nickering of ponies. Back
and forth between the stable and the cabin the outlaws
continually hurried. Dick knew what it all
meant. La Qua was preparing for his departure, to
take with him the cache of stolen fur.</p>
<p>As he stood watching and waiting, a daring plan
leaped into his mind. His breath caught at the very
thought of it&mdash;to walk boldly up and mingle with
the outlaws. They, in the general excitement and
confusion, would probably let him pass unnoticed.
As long as he kept away from the tell-tale lights of
the lanterns or the lamps in the cabin, he would probably
be safe enough.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>At any rate, he decided to do it. Thoughts of
Sergeant Richardson spurred him on. No effort or
sacrifice would be too great. It was little enough to
do for the man who had befriended him on so many
previous occasions.</p>
<p>He walked boldly forth, swung in behind a tall
figure hurrying toward the stable. Half way there,
he stopped, glancing furtively about. He tip-toed
over to the window on the side of the cabin opposite
the door and looked within.</p>
<p>For a moment his breath caught. He was both
startled and amazed at what he saw. The room,
near the far end, was stacked with bales of fur
reaching to a height of nearly five feet. Thousands
of dollars were represented here. Wonderful black
and cross-fox pelts! Rich-looking, unplucked beaver!
Lynx, marten, mink&mdash;even the glistening coat
of bruin himself, the least valuable of all. There
were furs so valuable, so precious, that a single bale
would have been more than sufficient to purchase a
king&rsquo;s ransom.</p>
<p>A steady file of men entered and departed. Each
carried away a heavy burden. Standing over them,
La Qua threatened and gesticulated fearful lest a
moment might be wasted. It was evident that the
outlaw was thoroughly frightened and intended to
rush through the work as quickly as possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s gaze turned from the cache to the opposite
end of the room in the hope that he might see Sergeant
Richardson. But, although he craned his neck
in the effort, he could discern nothing. He had decided
to slip around to another side of the dwelling,
when the sound of footsteps came from the darkness
beyond. Instinctively, he flattened himself against
the wall of the cabin. The steps came closer. A
vague form! A start of surprise&mdash;Rand!</p>
<p>The policeman did not see him at once, but Dick
drew his attention by whistling softly and very soon
the two stood close together gripping each other&rsquo;s
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky you&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; whispered Dick. &ldquo;Just
take a peep inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that Richardson&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; said Corporal
Rand when he had stepped back. &ldquo;As I came
out to the clearing, I thought I saw two of the outlaws
carrying something between them. Possibly
the sergeant. I had no way of stealing up on them
without being detected. So I decided to come on
here and await their arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is Richardson, do you think we can get him
away from the outlaws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What plan would you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until La Qua has taken out all of the fur
and the pack-train is ready to start. They&rsquo;ll be compelled
to leave Richardson here under guard. Our
chance will come then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Two powerful breeds appeared at the door soon
after, carrying the prostrate form of Sergeant Richardson.
They dropped him, none too gently, on the
floor close to the fire-place. The prisoner&rsquo;s limbs
were bound. He was unconscious, his face ghastly
white except where a small stream of blood trickled
down from his forehead.</p>
<p>Sudden rage seared Dick&rsquo;s mind. His friendship
for the police sergeant was great and he resented the
malicious attack upon him. He could hardly contain
himself as the packers left their work and advanced
in a curious group, only to be driven back again by
the cursing, perspiring La Qua. Then as a vent for
his outraged feelings, the outlaw kicked the unconscious
man in the ribs.</p>
<p>At sight of this gross treatment, Rand started forward,
scarcely able to suppress his cry of rage. He
checked himself, but one hand gripped Dick&rsquo;s arm,
fingers digging into the flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could almost kill him for that!&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>The cache diminished quickly. All that remained
of the bulky pile in a few minutes more were a few
scattered bales, lying on the floor at the far end of
the room. Corporal Rand and Dick were waiting
impatiently for the completion of the task, when suddenly
the policeman&rsquo;s sharp intake of breath drew
the other&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shades of Lucifer!&rdquo; gasped the corporal. &ldquo;Look
at that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>At first Dick did not understand, but presently he
saw the cause of the corporal&rsquo;s excitement. A low
cry of admiration escaped his own lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s Toma! The nerve of him!
Can you imagine anything more foolhardy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma it was&mdash;Toma, sober and unconcerned as
ever. In the guise of a packer, he had joined the
other half-breeds and Indians. He followed closely
behind two strapping natives, picked up a bale of fur
and walked out with it. Twice more in the next few
minutes he repeated this performance. On his third
trip, however, all the fur had been removed. La Qua
and a somewhat short and corpulent half-breed of
indeterminate age were the only occupants of the
room. These two looked up, as if resenting Toma&rsquo;s
intrusion. Then they sprang back, hands high in
the air, as a dangerous-looking automatic seemed
to leap into the young guide&rsquo;s hand. Calmly, Toma
ordered the two men back against the wall and disarmed
them.</p>
<p>Dick followed Rand and the two stormed through
the door, revolvers in readiness. They called out to
Toma not to shoot. The corporal yanked down a
coil of rope from a peg on the wall and proceeded
to bind the outlaws, at the same time ordering Dick
to bolt and lock the door, then to release Richardson.</p>
<p>La Qua was pale with fury, swearing vengeance
upon the police.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh can&rsquo;t get away with this,&rdquo; he snarled.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay good an&rsquo; plenty. Jus&rsquo; remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to answer for my conduct here,&rdquo;
laughed Rand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma and Rand dragged the bodies across the
floor, concealing them behind a pile of blankets.
Then they turned to examine the sergeant.</p>
<p>His injuries were not serious. Already he showed
signs of returning consciousness. Rand brought water
and bathed and dressed the wound with a skill
and precision that struck Dick&rsquo;s admiration.</p>
<p>Someone pounded on the door. Drawing his revolver,
the policeman hurried over, shot the bolt,
swung open the door, concealing himself behind it.
A tall, fierce-visaged man stepped into the room, demanding
harshly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who locked this door? Where&rsquo;s La Qua? The
boys are ready to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly he perceived that he had committed a
blunder. Dick and Toma he had never seen before.
Slightly puzzled, he took one step forward, when
he felt the steel muzzle of Rand&rsquo;s revolver poking
him in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand right where you are,&rdquo; said the corporal
pleasantly. &ldquo;Glad you came in. Permit me to relieve
you of your hardware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One glance into the steady eyes, a look at the
familiar uniform, and the intruder saw the futility
of resistance. Yet there was bluster in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;It means that the fun&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; Rand stated evenly.
&ldquo;Stand right where you are! So the pack-train&rsquo;s
ready to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner made no reply. Tall, sullen, resentful&mdash;unflinchingly
he met the cool gray eyes of the
mounted policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, speak up! I mean business!&rdquo; Rand
shoved his revolver into the man&rsquo;s ribs again. There
was nothing pleasant about his voice now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ready tuh start if yuh want to know,&rdquo;
begrudgingly answered the outlaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you heading straight for the pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the hesitation. Again the revolver fondling
the man&rsquo;s ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Rand, cooly deliberate. &ldquo;You
can go out and tell them to start. Tell them La Qua
is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoner stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out. Yuh mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not alone. I&rsquo;ll go with you. I&rsquo;ll be
standing right behind you when you give them those
orders. But before we go, you might as well understand
that there&rsquo;s to be no trickery. No treachery.
It might prove fatal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand opened the door, making a gesture with
one arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of here&mdash;and watch your step! I&rsquo;ll have my
gun on you every minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The door closed softly. The sound of retreating
footsteps, a pregnant silence&mdash;a period of waiting
which seemed interminable. Then the door opened
again and Rand and the prisoner appeared. In the
eyes of the policeman there sparkled a triumphant
light. He turned to Dick with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone. Never suspected anything. Told
them that La Qua and our friend here would follow
at their leisure. Bring me the rest of that rope,
Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They trussed the man and dragged him back to
the far corner of the room to keep company with
La Qua. Again they stood in front of Richardson,
who lay with half-closed eyes. He had not yet recovered
consciousness. Rand spoke quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a minute to lose. Every moment
counts. Toma, I&rsquo;m going to ask you to remain here
to guard these prisoners while I hurry on after the
pack-train. You, Dick, will return to Sandy and
conduct him here. As soon as you do that, Sandy
will relieve Toma. In another hour or two, Richardson
will be able to sit up. It won&rsquo;t be long before
he recovers completely. You and Toma are to follow
and overtake me. I may need your help. Think
you&rsquo;ll be able to follow our tracks, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble do that,&rdquo; nodded the guide. &ldquo;We find
&rsquo;em all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Dick found Sandy without much difficulty. His
chum was shivering from the cold. Also he had
grown impatient and resentful, as his first words
indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you finally consent to come back and
let me know how things are? I was just getting
ready to leave this place. Surely, the corporal didn&rsquo;t
expect me to stay here all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sandy,&rdquo; placated Dick. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t
get here any sooner. Too bad you&rsquo;re cold.&rdquo; His voice
rose animatedly. &ldquo;And good news! We&rsquo;ve found
Richardson and have taken three prisoners&mdash;one of
them La Qua. Rand is following the pack-train in
the direction of the pass. We must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Good work! I suppose you&rsquo;re one of
the heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do a
thing. All the credit is due Rand and Toma. Both
were wonderful. I&rsquo;ll tell you about it sometime.
But now we must hurry. Toma and I are to follow
Rand. You&rsquo;re to remain with Richardson and the
prisoners in the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s teeth chattered. &ldquo;Hope it&rsquo;s
warm over there. I&rsquo;ve caught a chill. Anyway, good
luck to you, Dick. When do you think you&rsquo;ll be
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a long way to the coast. Hundreds
of miles, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast!&rdquo; almost shrieked Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Dick a little proudly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going
straight through to the Pacific!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A SCOUT RETURNS</span></h2>
<p>Contrary to Dick&rsquo;s expectations, Sandy did not
resent being left behind. True, the young Scotchman
had experienced a certain amount of regret to
learn that he was to be separated from his two
chums and miss the excitement and adventure of the
western trip, yet this feeling passed quickly. In
spite of his occasional rebellious mood and seeming
stubbornness, Sandy was really a philosopher. His
grumbling and complaining seldom were taken seriously.
Under the surface, somewhere deep down
within him, were the flowing springs of an unconquerable
good nature.</p>
<p>He knew that it was necessary for someone to
stay with Sergeant Richardson and the prisoners,
and he accepted Rand&rsquo;s orders unhesitatingly. Even
if he couldn&rsquo;t go along with Dick and Toma, he
could at least prove his worth in other ways. He&rsquo;d
see this thing through to the finish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Shortly after the two boys had left, Sergeant
Richardson completely recovered consciousness. It
was not long before he sat up and began to ask
questions. He smiled a little wanly when he had
been informed of Corporal Rand&rsquo;s successful strategy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they got La Qua. Tomorrow, Sandy,
we&rsquo;ll take these prisoners back to Wandley&rsquo;s post.
Perhaps we can find a place where we can lock them
up. I&rsquo;ll put a man in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; approved Sandy. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t far from
here. At the same time, we can find out how Pearly
is getting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, the policeman walked over, a little unsteadily,
to the corner where the prisoners lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, La Qua, I&rsquo;m glad to see you here. Have
you anything to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently, he had. He immediately broke forth
in a storm of invective that scorched the already
overheated room. Sandy&rsquo;s ears fairly tingled as he
listened to the horrible oaths and scathing denouncement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe yuh got me now,&rdquo; he snarled, concluding
his tirade, &ldquo;but yuh ain&rsquo;t finished with me yet. The
knock on the head yuh got a while back won&rsquo;t be
nothin&rsquo; compared to what&rsquo;s coming to yuh. Yuh
ain&rsquo;t got no call to meddle in honest men&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honest men!&rdquo; gasped the sergeant, plainly taken
aback. &ldquo;Honest men,&rdquo; he repeated, staring in a
sort of grim fascination at the row of evil faces in
front of him. &ldquo;Why, my good fellow, I wish you&rsquo;d
explain one or two things to my satisfaction. I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s roar of laughter interrupted him. La
Qua seized the opportunity to declare venomously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to explain nothin&rsquo;. If one or two
o&rsquo; your men got hurt, it&rsquo;s all on account o&rsquo; their
meddling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman saw the folly of further argument.
He turned back to where Sandy stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to find something to eat,&rdquo; he proposed.
&ldquo;A hot cup of tea would go well right now. I&rsquo;m
famished. After we&rsquo;ve eaten, you can roll in, Sandy,
while I stand guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty kind of you, sergeant, but I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll accept. You need the rest more than I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richardson smiled and patted Sandy&rsquo;s thatch of
yellow hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you insist. I&rsquo;ll agree to take advantage
of your offer, but only on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Sandy asked wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you wake me up in three hours&rsquo; time. A
sort of compromise, you see. In that way we&rsquo;ll both
get a little rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept your terms,&rdquo; said Sandy with great
solemnity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>A search in the cupboard behind the fireplace was
rewarded by the discovery of a small container, full
of tea, sugar in an earthen jar, and a stack of doubtful-looking
bannock, piled high on a granite plate.
A kettle was soon simmering over the fire.</p>
<p>When they had eaten, Richardson arose and,
walking over, inquired if any of the prisoners wanted
refreshments. La Qua spurned the offer with a
hair-burning oath. The others were more tractable.
Yes, they were hungry. They would consider it a
great favor if monsieur would do as he said.</p>
<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the policeman unbound
the arms of the three men, while Sandy
brought tea and bannock. Later, he even permitted
one of the half-breeds to smoke. Then he bound
them up again.</p>
<p>Long before the coming of daylight, the party
started back on the trail to Wandley&rsquo;s. Arriving
there without incident, four hours later, Sandy and
Richardson were considerably startled when the door
opened and a stalky, well-knit figure emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; shouted Sandy, &ldquo;Malemute Slade!
Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands with the police scout, beaming
over the good fortune that had brought them together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh, Sandy, I kind o&rsquo; thought it was about time
to come mushin&rsquo; in. Been up in the foothills fer
nearly three weeks. But by the looks o&rsquo; it, I&rsquo;m two
days late. Wished I&rsquo;d been here when that Nitchie
took his shot at Pearly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>He paused as his gaze wandered in the direction
of the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sufferin&rsquo; pole-cats! What&rsquo;s all this scum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malemute Slade&rsquo;s critical eye ran over them, seeming
to measure each in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine specimens, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he rumbled on, half
to himself. &ldquo;Looks like the scourings from Hades.
There ain&rsquo;t a single one o&rsquo; them I&rsquo;d trust any further
than I could see. But where did yuh get &rsquo;em all,
sergeant? An&rsquo; why did yuh leave the hungriest wolf
of &rsquo;em all scot free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Murky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richardson smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, Slade, we&rsquo;re not quite ready
for him yet. We haven&rsquo;t a thing thus far we can
use as evidence against him. We wouldn&rsquo;t have taken
these men here either, if there had been any way of
getting around it. We won&rsquo;t press charges against
any of them until we have secured the fur which
was cached over there at Settlement Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So yuh found the cache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Richardson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about
it presently. But first, give me a hand to look after
these men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>As he spoke, the policeman jerked his head in the
direction of the door. A steady stream of the curious
were pouring out. An inquisitive throng soon
gathered around them. On every side rose guttural
exclamations, accompanied by much chattering and
shaking of heads. Attracted by the commotion,
Wandley himself appeared presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, sergeant!&rdquo; he hailed the policeman.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Bring your men inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richardson drew the free trader aside and a whispered
consultation ensued. At its conclusion, Wandley
led the way to a small building, which had previously
been used for storing fur, but which, during
recent years, had become too small to accommodate
the trader&rsquo;s growing business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can fit up this place to suit yourself. It&rsquo;s
strongly built and will probably serve your purpose.
I have a padlock inside for the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before La Qua and his followers
were locked up and a guard, recruited from the
crowd, stationed just outside. Then Sandy accompanied
Malemute Slade and Richardson to Pearly&rsquo;s
room. The wounded man smiled cheerfully as they
entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Sandy was overjoyed at the remarkable change in
Pearly&rsquo;s appearance. Although still running a high
fever, he had taken a turn for the better. The greatest
danger had passed. Sergeant Richardson stood
near the bed but did not speak. A deep hush had
fallen over the room. Suddenly the grizzled veteran
of a hundred trails put out one hand and permitted
it to rest for one brief moment upon the wounded
man&rsquo;s head. That was all. But many of the harsh
lines in the face of the police sergeant had softened.
Silently he turned away, motioning to Slade and
Sandy to follow him. They repaired to the room,
which had been placed at their disposal. Closing the
door after him, Richardson lost no time in getting
down to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me, Slade, where we got our prisoners.
Over at Murky&rsquo;s cache. We had a little
trouble there. If you&rsquo;ll listen closely I&rsquo;ll give you
full particulars of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the policeman had finished his narrative,
Sandy noted the impression it had made upon the
scout. Malemute&rsquo;s eyes were shining with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where Murky had his cache. Yuh can
believe it or not, sergeant, but I passed that place
not more than two days ago. I didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo; that
looked suspicious. Mebbe it was a good thing I didn&rsquo;t
stop to investigate. It might o&rsquo; spoiled ever&rsquo;thing.
So Rand is followin&rsquo; the pack-train through Blind
Man&rsquo;s Pass? Can yuh beat that? Here I&rsquo;ve been
searchin&rsquo; fer nearly a month an&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Richardson drummed softly on the
table. He looked up and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m badly mistaken, the exact location of
the pass will soon be public property. Perhaps tomorrow
by this time, Rand and the two boys will
have entered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I was with them, sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go later. Just now I have other work
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to take &rsquo;em back to Mackenzie barracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be safer there,&rdquo; nodded the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; out after Murky then, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Rand may have more to do than he&rsquo;s bargained
for. I think I&rsquo;ll take Sandy here and set
out after them. Murky will have to wait. I don&rsquo;t
believe he&rsquo;ll attempt to escape. He&rsquo;ll probably stay
over at Good Faith for a few weeks longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few weeks!&rdquo; sputtered Malemute. &ldquo;Why, he
ain&rsquo;t there right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. When I come in a while ago, Wandley told
me he&rsquo;d seen Murky again jes&rsquo; a few hours before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! Then he didn&rsquo;t go back to Fort
Good Faith after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see how he could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which way did he go? Did you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wandley didn&rsquo;t seem to know. If anyone was to
ask me fer an opinion, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s out scouting fer
more fur.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Richardson rose thoughtfully to his feet and
walked over to the window. The bleak, cheerless
landscape met his gaze. Sandy, who had a good
view of the policeman&rsquo;s face, saw the jaw set grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be able to pick up a trace of him somewhere
during the next few days. Of course, that
means that my trip through the pass must be postponed
for a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and smiled at Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m out making my investigations, you&rsquo;d
better stay right here. If you wish, upon my return,
you can accompany me on the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you, sergeant. I&rsquo;m anxious to go
through Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass and join Dick and Toma.&rdquo;
Then more plaintively: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t change your
mind, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Richardson and Malemute Slade laughed at
the young man&rsquo;s earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sandy, a promise is a promise. I&rsquo;ll not go
back on my word.&rdquo; Richardson turned and addressed
Slade. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better make arrangements to
take the prisoners over to barracks as quickly as
possible. I&rsquo;d suggest that you start tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start this afternoon if you say the word,
sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You need a few hours in which to rest up.
Tomorrow will do almost as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a nod and a smile for both of them, the
policeman turned quickly and strode out of the
room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">FOLLOWING THE PACK-TRAIN</span></h2>
<p>Through an opaque darkness filled with the oppressive
silence of Arctic night, Dick and Toma
made their way. A few stars had come out like
wayward wanderers. On every side were gray, unfamiliar
shapes. Objects were shadowy and indistinct.
Wolves and coyotes made the only sound
heard across that weird and mysterious wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to find him pretty soon, Toma,&rdquo; Dick
broke forth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been travelling for an hour
now, and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve been making better progress
than the pack-train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to the foot of a slope and started up,
side by side, their moccasined feet swishing through
the freshly fallen snow. Gaining the summit of the
hill, they paused for breath. Then the quick ears of
the guide, straining always for some sound that
might be significant, detected a faint rustling ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear him. We go careful now. Mebbe him
Corporal Rand. But no take chances. Not always
be too sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Rand it was. He stood waiting for them, one
hand on his hip, the other raised in a warning gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ahead&mdash;not more than a few rods. Listen,
and you can hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can hear something,&rdquo; whispered Dick.
&ldquo;Did you think we were never coming, corporal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact,&rdquo; Rand answered him, &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect you for another half hour. You&rsquo;ve
made good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three started forward slowly, keeping always
within sound of the cavalcade in front. Sometimes
they approached so closely that they could hear the
voices of the packers and occasionally the snarling
of the dogs. Soon they had learned something of
importance: La Qua&rsquo;s pack-train consisted both of
ponies and dog teams. There were seven or eight
horses, in addition to four teams of huskies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Rand, &ldquo;La Qua was in a
predicament. The snow storm interfered with his
plans. His original intention, evidently, was to take
only pack-horses. The heavy snow made this inadvisable.
But he didn&rsquo;t have as many dog teams as
he required to move away the cache. So he was
forced to use the ponies as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Just before daybreak, the pack-train halted in the
lee of a small mountain. From a position a few
hundred yards away, concealed by rocks, Rand and
the two boys watched it. Breakfast was soon in
progress. Smoke curled up from several campfires.
It was not an altogether unpleasant scene and
Dick&rsquo;s mouth watered at the thought of the nourishing
meal, piping hot, the outlaws would presently sit
down to. He even imagined he could smell the
appetizing odor of frying bacon and the pungent
aroma of coffee. A little crestfallen, he nibbled at
his own emergency rations, huddling down against
a flat surface of rock.</p>
<p>Later, Dick looked out again, eyes bleared and
bloodshot. Every muscle in his body ached. Lack
of sleep had induced a strange condition&mdash;an overpowering
lassitude he could not shake off. The rustling
of a pine tree near by had become a sing-song,
half-musical chant, which momentarily grew louder.
His vision played him false. Objects around him
were distorted, sometimes grotesque. His mind had
lost its function. Nothing was real. Nothing mattered.
He fell asleep, sitting up&mdash;a sleep so sound,
so intense, so deep that Rand saw the uselessness of
attempting to wake him.</p>
<p>When he recovered consciousness, he heard the
corporal speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming to, Toma. Give him another shake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stared about him guiltily. He surmised that
he had slept only a few minutes but the sight of the
round orb of the sun, high above the horizon, quickly
disillusioned him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you wake me?&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;How long have I been here? What time is it, corporal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock. You&rsquo;ve slept four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did?&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s eyes were wide with dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did. But don&rsquo;t think I blame you,&rdquo;
Rand laughed. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t help it. It was inevitable.
No person can manage without sleep. I
had a little doze myself. We can&rsquo;t lose the pack-train
now. It will be easy to follow their tracks in
broad daylight. We&rsquo;ll catch up to them again before
nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All day they travelled, passing through a country
of hills and rocks, with mountain peaks towering
above them. The summits of the mountains were
lost in an enveloping, vaporous mist. Shaggy
heights were resplendent in rainbow garb. The deep
brown of rock surfaces was a decided contrast to
the scintillating white of the trail.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the tracks led them across
a wind-swept plateau, thence down to a narrow defile
which ran uninterruptedly westward for a distance
of four or five miles. As they approached its
end, Corporal Rand was surprised into a quick ejaculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see how we can get out of this. Surely
they didn&rsquo;t climb those slippery rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>A few yards further on, they found the solution
to the mystery. On the left they saw an opening in
the rocks, scarcely more than four feet wide&mdash;in
reality a wide crack that split the immense formation
of rock from top to bottom. Passing through
it, they emerged into what appeared to be a wide
valley, stretching far ahead. The corporal gasped
in amazement. Dick stood bewildered. Even Toma
so far forgot himself as to cry out in wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass!&rdquo; exclaimed the two boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass,&rdquo; replied the policeman. &ldquo;At
last a reality! Wonderful! I can scarcely credit
my senses. Beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &ldquo;I was never more astonished in
my life. No wonder the entrance to the pass is so
hard to find. Even now I doubt if I could go back
eight or ten miles and find my way here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange far-away look flecked the eyes of the
policeman. He glanced up at the receding walls of
the valley. Up, up, up, hundreds, thousands of feet
through an amber haze of sunlight, streaked here
and there with bright tints and shades. Magic
seemed to touch everything. Dick was obsessed with
a sense of unreality, of majestic heights, of vague
distances.</p>
<p>Along the comparatively level floor of the valley
lay only a few inches of snow. The tracks of the
pack-train could easily be seen. They were not difficult
to follow. There was no danger now of wandering
afield and losing their bearings. The mountains
shut them in&mdash;completely encompassed them.
Neither they nor the outlaws could clamber up the
unscalable heights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Their onward trek had assumed something of the
nature of an outing, a mysterious adventure through
unfamiliar scenes. In the hours that passed never
once did Dick lose interest in his surroundings.
Sleep had revived him and his spirits had risen accordingly.
He and his two companions hurried on,
conversing as gaily as if they were going to a holiday
festival.</p>
<p>Day ended with startling suddenness. But the
gloomy, threatening darkness of the preceding night
did not come. It was more radiant, softly nocturnal&mdash;a
half-moon riding across a bedecked, star-sprinkled
sky. Crackling northern lights. Clear, crisp,
exhilarating air. The only obscurities lay along the
shadowed walls of the valley, in the deep recesses
and fissures of the rocks.</p>
<p>Day after day, they fared westward amid scenes
of grandeur and magnificence. Never did they approach
closer than a mile or two to the outlaws. At
night very often they could see twinkling campfires
ahead. Frequently, on clear days, they perceived the
pack-train itself&mdash;tiny black dots, crawling like ants
over sugar or white sand. Once, climbing to the
commanding position of a huge crag, for nearly an
hour Dick watched the progress of the cavalcade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Outside of these minor incidents, there was little
of importance to distinguish one day from another.
Fortunately, there had been no marked change in
the weather. They were forced to conserve their supplies,
but now and again ptarmigan were secured,
making a much appreciated change in the monotony
of their diet. On the morning of the tenth day the
valley widened out and by evening they had made
their way out of the pass into a country of rugged
and broken contours. Soon the forest encroached.
Then the topography of the land became less undulating,
less forbidding. In the breath of the wind
they could smell the unmistakable tang of the Pacific.
It was shortly after this that a most mysterious incident
occurred.</p>
<p>It was afternoon, of a calm, sunshiny day, and
only a few hours previous they had picked up a
well-marked trail, leading to the westward. The
pack-train&mdash;they had good reason to believe&mdash;was
less than a mile ahead; and Dick and his two companions
were moving along slowly, when, unexpectedly
to their right, scarcely a hundred yards
back from the trail, they perceived a log cabin. Upon
closer approach, they saw that the place was inhabited.
A thin spiral of smoke curled up from the
mud chimney. Outside, stretched on convenient drying-frames,
were pelts of various wild animals.</p>
<p>Invariably cautious, Rand decided not to go in,
even though his visit might have been rewarded by
a goodly supply of fresh meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to risk it,&rdquo; he informed the boys. &ldquo;No
telling who lives there. I&rsquo;ve no desire to advertise
my presence. We&rsquo;d better conquer our curiosity and
our appetites and keep right on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now directly opposite the cabin. Dick
and Toma turned longing eyes in its direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Ponies!&rdquo; exclaimed Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; sharply demanded Rand.</p>
<p>The guide pointed. Back in the heavy underbrush,
near the edge of a natural clearing, were three ponies
staked out in the snow. The policeman&rsquo;s face instantly
became serious, though for what reason Dick
could not decide. From that moment, he grew more
and more thoughtful. Once or twice, as Dick looked
his way, he saw Rand shake his head. But in the
interest of new scenes, Dick quickly forgot the incident.
It was fully an hour later before it was
brought again to his attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer thing about those ponies,&rdquo; Rand mused
aloud. &ldquo;Seldom that these trappers keep any around.
It puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem strange,&rdquo; agreed Dick. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
imagine what use a trapper would have for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few miles farther on they passed a second
cabin, almost identical to the first. Here too was the
same phenomenon&mdash;except that at this place there
were two ponies instead of three. So amazed was
Rand that he stopped short and scratched his head
in perplexity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is a new one on me,&rdquo; he scowled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
travelled thousands of miles through the North,
met every type of trapper, both Indians and white
men, but this is the first time I have ever witnessed
this incongruity. Trappers with ponies! Dog
teams&mdash;yes! But ponies never! Can you explain it,
Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I not understand, corporal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice, during the next two days, the incident was
repeated. They passed other trappers&rsquo; shacks where
there were ponies. However, now the thing had become
such a commonplace occurrence that they ceased
to marvel at it. New interests occupied their attention.
The trail had widened and had become almost
a road. Indian villages were passed. They saw totem
poles. They crossed a river. Obliterated now were
the tracks of the pack-train. More and more traffic
with each succeeding day. One morning Dick made
a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we ought to hurry along and
catch up to them, corporal? They may be travelling
faster now and may give us the slip. We can slow
down again as soon as we catch sight of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; responded Rand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>There ensued a long period of forced marching,
during which the little party hardly took time to
eat or sleep. Hour after hour, they hurried on. The
pace began to tell. Nearly fifty-four hours later,
climbing to a height of land, they saw stretching out
before them, perhaps not more than ten miles away,
the huge, broad expanse of the ocean. But nowhere
along the trail ahead was there a sign of the pack-train.
Corporal Rand&rsquo;s face shadowed with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something mighty queer about this,&rdquo; he pronounced.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it. I&rsquo;m beginning to
feel like a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean, corporal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pack-train&mdash;&rdquo; the policeman&rsquo;s voice caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes,&rdquo; persisted Dick. &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand rubbed a hand across his troubled forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this, Dick: I can&rsquo;t believe that the outlaws
have been able to gain so quickly on us. I wonder
what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be ahead somewhere. We&rsquo;ve followed
them all the way. They couldn&rsquo;t just disappear in
thin air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before replying, the corporal brushed the snow
from a flat rock and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the natural hypothesis. But the facts don&rsquo;t
seem to bear it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said the policeman, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve been
hoodwinked. They&rsquo;ve contrived somehow to give
us the slip. I&rsquo;m positive we won&rsquo;t find them ahead.
Do you suppose we passed their camp during the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">THE CORPORAL UPBRAIDS HIMSELF</span></h2>
<p>During the ensuing consultation there appeared
to be a diversity of opinion. Toma thought that they
ought to retrace their steps in an attempt to find
out where the outlaws had turned off the trail, while
Dick still held to the belief that the pack-train must
be somewhere ahead. As for Rand, he did not immediately
declare himself. Sitting on the rock, his
chin resting in his hands, he was immersed in deep
thought. Nearly ten minutes elapsed before he
looked up and addressed his two companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might as well be perfectly frank. I&rsquo;m stuck. I
must confess that I don&rsquo;t know where the pack-train
is. It may be behind or it may be ahead. If
they&mdash;the outlaws&mdash;are ahead, I will say they&rsquo;ve been
moving faster than at any time since we left Settlement
Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick stood impatiently, hands on hips, one moccasined
foot tracing patterns and queer hieroglyphics
in the soft snow at the side of the trail. Toma&rsquo;s face
was inscrutable. What lay behind his mask-like
features no one might guess. Another interval of
silence&mdash;of inactivity. Finally Rand rose to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on,&rdquo; came his decision. &ldquo;I doubt if we&rsquo;ll
find them ahead, but we can search for the cabin in
which the furs are stored. The cache must be there
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the day, they came out upon a tree-covered
plain close to the Pacific. They camped within
a thick shelter of pines, rolled in their blankets, and
on the following morning inaugurated a careful,
painstaking search.</p>
<p>Weary and discouraged, almost out of food, at the
end of the second day they found themselves on the
south side of a tiny inlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be getting nowhere,&rdquo; Rand confessed.
&ldquo;I believe now that if there is a cache, it&rsquo;s
farther back from the coast. We&rsquo;ll skirt this inlet
and then return inland to see if by any chance we
can find a trace of the pack-train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doggedly, in silence, the boys trailed along after
Rand. Half an hour later they broke through a
tangle of underbrush to a clearing beyond. Their
hearts leaped with joy. Built out from the shore
was a crudely constructed landing wharf, fashioned
entirely from pine and spruce timbers with a covering
of hewed poles. Close to the wharf&mdash;and what
struck their attention still more forcibly&mdash;stood a
large log building without windows&mdash;and with only
one door. It was a warehouse&mdash;nothing else! Probably
the cache itself!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted Dick, as he broke into a run.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They brought up before the door of the building,
panting breathlessly. The door was padlocked. In
feverish haste, Toma secured a couple of sharp
rocks and commenced hammering upon the clasp.
Rand was smiling now for the first time in many
hours. When the efforts of Toma had been rewarded,
he stepped forward and yanked open the
barrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murky Nichols has been storing fur in here for
the past three or four years,&rdquo; he told the boys. &ldquo;This
will be the largest cache of stolen fur ever seized by
the police. It will mark the end of a series of lawless
depredations by the cleverest gang of crooks that has
ever operated in the North.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had ceased speaking, the corporal stepped
inside. The place was dank, dark, evil-smelling. It
was impossible to see anything. Standing just behind
him, Toma struck a match. The tiny flame
flared up, but failed to light the mysterious, dark
recesses of the room. Dick and Toma alternated in
lighting matches. They pushed their way farther
into the darkness, groping about like ghouls in some
subterranean passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Moisture had sprung out upon Dick&rsquo;s forehead.
He was trembling and hot. Each tiny taper carried
them farther and farther on their round of exploration.
Finally, Corporal Rand stopped short and
threw up his hands in an exasperated gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shades of a purple skunk!&rdquo; he cried out angrily.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here! Pshaw! The place is as
clean and bare as Mother Hubbard&rsquo;s cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disappointment succeeding this announcement
was keen. Dick&rsquo;s shoulders slumped and his head
drooped as he turned dejectedly and made his way
back to the door. Toma was the only one who had
anything to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you something, corporal. Mebbe no fur
here now, but all same Murky Nichols use this place
to make &rsquo;em cache. I know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo; growled Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell by smell,&rdquo; answered the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; broke forth the corporal. &ldquo;Fur has
been stored here. I can detect a familiar odor myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you explain it?&rdquo; asked Dick. &ldquo;You
were under the impression that Nichols had a two-year
supply of stolen fur here. What has become of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m no wizard,&rdquo; Rand answered
a little testily, &ldquo;or I might be able to answer your
question. All I know is that Nichols has been shipping
fur for the last three or four years. As I told
you once before, we believe that a large shipment
was taken from here to Seattle by someone, who
either purchased the fur in good faith or who is a
confederate of Murky&rsquo;s. Perhaps this person comes
up here oftener than we surmised. It may be that
he has just recently cleaned out this cache and will
return later for the fur now being brought here by
pack-train. Of only one thing am I reasonably sure,
and that is that this is the place where Nichols sends
his shipments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we wait here, pretty soon pack-train will come.
What you think?&rdquo; Toma raised questioning eyes to
the mounted policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rand, &ldquo;the pack-train will come here.
We can&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Dick spoke hesitatingly,
&ldquo;is why the outlaws haven&rsquo;t arrived days
ago. They were ahead of us when we started. Now
we&rsquo;re ahead of them. How do you explain it, corporal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can think of only one explanation. The boat
from Seattle may not be due here for a week or
two. In the interim, the outlaws are putting up
somewhere along the trail, where there are better
facilities for feeding the men and caring for the
dogs and ponies. We must have passed them in the
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we do?&rdquo; asked Dick. &ldquo;Go back and
try to find them or stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>Rand made his decision promptly. &ldquo;We might as
well stay here. They&rsquo;ll have to come sooner or later.
All we can do now is to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considerably cheered, the three walked out of the
building and made their way over to the landing
wharf. As they stood there, a disconcerting thought
occurred to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlaws will be sure to see our tracks around
the warehouse when they come with the fur,&rdquo; he
pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; said Rand. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
know yet that they&rsquo;ve been followed by the police.
I doubt if they have a single suspicion. However,
when we go back, we&rsquo;d better repair the damage to
the lock and door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing there, Dick half-expected to see at any
moment a vessel round the heavily wooded point
and come steaming toward them. He thought about
the boat from Seattle. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great sport
if the ship would arrive ahead of its schedule? If
this happened, would they drop anchor in the deep
waters of the inlet and wait for the coming of the
outlaws? What action would Rand take? Would
he attempt to capture the vessel, or would he fall
back out of sight to lay in concealment until the arrival
of the pack-train?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>The first light of oncoming dawn struck Dick&rsquo;s
eyes on the following morning when he peeped out
from between his Hudson&rsquo;s Bay blankets. It was
really still too early to get up and it provoked him
to find that he had awakened so soon. Neither Toma
nor the corporal would be astir for another two
hours. What had aroused him? He sat up impatiently,
tucked the blankets around his feet. Then he
heard a voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I am. I must be suffering from a
mental relapse. What is the matter with me? A
blind bat! A nincompoop! Honestly, I need a
guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assertions were made with such deliberateness,
with such sincerity, that Dick grinned in spite
of himself. He turned his head quickly in the direction
of Rand&rsquo;s bed and discovered that person
sitting up like himself, and staring moodily out
through the thick obstruction of trees. Rand&rsquo;s back
was towards him. Apparently, the policeman believed
that his remarks had fallen upon heedless ears. Naturally
he supposed that the boys still slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, corporal?&rdquo; pleasantly inquired the
eavesdropper.</p>
<p>Rand started and half-turned. His manner was a
little sheepish, like that of a boy caught in some
foolish prank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you heard me?&rdquo; Rand turned completely
around and grinned. &ldquo;Well, anyway, you know now
what I think of myself. When you have finished
dressing, Dick, come and clout me over the head.
You have my permission. I&rsquo;ve been guilty of blithering
idiocy. How I ever contrived to persuade the
R. N. W. M. P. to take me into the service will
always remain an unsolved mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed outright. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you do yourself
justice, corporal. What makes you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My conscience hurts me. I&rsquo;m an ass. When I
awoke about twenty minutes ago, it suddenly dawned
on me how completely we&rsquo;ve been fooled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; inquired Dick, wondering if the
policeman had taken leave of his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when they gave us the slip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s it exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t your fault. We&rsquo;ve been careful
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand threw back his blankets and commenced
to dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Dick,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;when we
passed the first trapper&rsquo;s shack on the trail this side
of Dominion Range, and Toma called our attention
to the three ponies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may recall,&rdquo; Rand went on, &ldquo;that the presence
of the ponies there puzzled me. Subsequently
the thing was repeated at other trappers&rsquo; cabins along
the route we were travelling. Now, as I look back
upon it all, I&rsquo;m ashamed of my stupidity, I should
have known right away what was taking place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ponies were part of the pack-train. The
furs were unloaded at various places along the line.
As the pack-train progressed, it became smaller, until,
finally, nothing was left of it. That explains
many things. It explains why we have been unable
to overtake the outlaws. Murky&rsquo;s precious shipment
is scattered along the trail over a distance of twenty
miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a trick!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed. &ldquo;Pretty clever
ruse, wasn&rsquo;t it? The outlaws must have known all
the time that we were following them. It took a
genius to think of a plan like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they knew we were following
them,&rdquo; stated the corporal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the usual
procedure, inaugurated by Murky himself. Nichols
does not feel safe with all of his eggs in one basket.
He doesn&rsquo;t believe in taking unnecessary risks. The
trappers who live along the trail, where we saw the
ponies, are probably in his employ&mdash;really not trappers
at all. They guard the caches of stolen fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand paused for a moment, then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, Dick, how many of those
trappers&rsquo; shacks there were where we saw ponies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three,&rdquo; answered Dick quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we went past several where we saw none.
Do you recall whether there were dogs around these
places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Rand mumbled something which Dick did not
catch. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come to this conclusion: Those five
or six places harbour the outlaws&mdash;all of them, every
member of the pack-train. I&rsquo;m convinced that if we
went back there tomorrow we&rsquo;d also find the fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Murky has five or six separate caches, why
did he build the warehouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t very well get along without it. Consider
his position. The boat from Seattle may on
occasion be two or three days late. What is to be
done with the fur? It is too valuable to be piled up
on the landing wharf in all kinds of weather. The
warehouse would be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand did not complete the sentence.
Dick had jumped to his feet and was waving his
arms about wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it comes! There it comes!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;The boat! It has entered the inlet. Look, corporal!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">MURKY NICHOLS!</span></h2>
<p>The vessel came to anchor not far from the
landing wharf. The throb of her engines ceased.
Immaculate in fresh paint&mdash;a dull gray&mdash;she rode
prettily in the water. Her graceful lines resembled
those of a yacht. It was evident that she had been
built for speed. Slung out over port and starboard,
were two small boats, one of which, judging from
the plaintive creaking of ropes, was about to be lowered.
The three watched her for a while, endeavoring
to make out some of the figures on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be days ahead of her schedule,&rdquo; surmised
Rand. &ldquo;The outlaws would never have cached
the fur along the line if they had known she was
coming in so soon. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard rather than saw the oncoming figure&mdash;someone
trampling along through the brush. Then
the newcomer broke into the clearing and for the first
time his form stood revealed.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s throat contracted. He shrank back against
the thicket, reaching out for support. A faintly
audible exclamation rose to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murky Nichols!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>The silence that fell over the little party was so
deep, so breathless that they could hear the thicket
rustling in the faint breeze. Corporal Rand stared
at Dick, and that young man returned the gaze with
an expression that was indescribable. Toma whispered
hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How him get here? I thought he go back to
Fort Good Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently not!&rdquo; Rand gritted from between set
teeth. &ldquo;A ruse, a trick&mdash;he&rsquo;s full of them. One
never knows what Nichols is planning, or where he
is likely to be at any stated time. He bobs up everywhere.
It has always been difficult to follow his
movements. He&rsquo;s here now. It&rsquo;s something I hadn&rsquo;t
bargained for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lanky, indolent figure slumped past the warehouse,
heading for the wharf. A gray felt hat was
pulled down over his forehead, the brim almost resting
upon his shaggy eyebrows. Reaching his objective,
he pulled a knife and plug of tobacco from
his pocket and lazily sliced off a generous hunk.
Having completed this important operation, he
glanced up, slowly raised his arm and began signalling
the vessel.</p>
<p>There sounded the creaking of hawsers, then a
low splash as the boat hit the water. Two men, one
of them in a blue cap and uniform, rowed for the
shore. They reached the landing wharf, clambering
up with the assistance of Murky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Although they could see everything that happened,
Rand and the two boys were unable to catch more
than a low murmur of sound coming from the conspirators.
Once the voice of the man in uniform
rose appreciably, but even then they could not catch
what was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my right arm to be able to sit under that
wharf and listen to them,&rdquo; Rand whispered eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you think them fellows do?&rdquo; Toma wished
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine. Something&rsquo;s up. I wonder why
Murky didn&rsquo;t bring along his pack-train. What&rsquo;s
the reason for the delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the words left the policeman&rsquo;s mouth,
when he jumped back, nerves taut, eyes shining. A
perfect bedlam of sound arose. It drifted across to
them through the trees, disturbing the stillness, the
calm of the forest&rsquo;s solitude. They could hear the
voices of men, the whinnying of ponies, the guttural
shouts of packers, the swishing and snapping of underbrush.
Dick seized Toma&rsquo;s arm and held it in
a vise-like grip. In a sort of stupor, he noticed that
Rand was filling a rifle-clip with cartridges. The
pack-train came into view at the edge of the clearing&mdash;ten
horses, four dog teams and six men. They
gathered about the warehouse, a confused mass of
horses, dogs and men, seeming to hesitate, in reality
waiting for a signal from Nichols.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>It was a crucial moment. Dick knew that the time
had come for action, yet the thought terrified him.
What chance had they against so many? Not counting
Nichols, there were six of the outlaws and probably
as many more sailors aboard the yacht. Chills,
like tiny currents of ice, coursed down Dick&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<p>The policeman seemed to sense Dick&rsquo;s feelings,
almost to read his thoughts. He reached over and
patted the younger man affectionately on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Dick, we&rsquo;ll come out all right. Just
keep cool. You&rsquo;ve been anxious to join the Royal
Mounted&mdash;now show me the stuff you&rsquo;re made of.
You too, Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, corporal, I stick by you when we make
&rsquo;em big fight. You just tell &rsquo;em Toma what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our first move?&rdquo; asked Dick. &ldquo;Do you
intend to meet the outlaws face to face? Aren&rsquo;t
there too many for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way to defeat a gang like this is to
capture its leader. That&rsquo;s what I propose to do now.
Murky Nichols is the man I want. He&rsquo;s the directing
force here, the brains behind every move. The
others are mere chessmen. He&rsquo;s the player. I intend
to walk right over in the presence of every one
of his men and take him prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; gasped Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do it.&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice was calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>It was a breathless, incredible thing that Rand
proposed. A desperate plan indeed&mdash;seemingly foolhardy!
It required bravery of the deepest brand&mdash;nerves
of steel and a courage that would never falter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make it,&rdquo; almost whimpered Dick. &ldquo;A
bullet will bring you down before you go fifty
yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; the corporal answered, only a
slight tremor in his voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a psychology
about this thing, Dick, that neither you nor I understand.
At first, they&rsquo;ll be too startled to do anything.
By the time they have recovered from their surprise,
they won&rsquo;t be able to shoot without endangering
the lives of Nichols and the two sailors. At any
rate, I&rsquo;m willing to take the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair!&rdquo; Dick protested hotly. &ldquo;Why should
you run all the risks alone? Corporal Rand, I won&rsquo;t
permit it. If you&rsquo;re going to walk over there, I&rsquo;m
going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suspicion of a twinkle showed in Rand&rsquo;s unwavering
gray eyes. But his voice was stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in command here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; argued Dick. &ldquo;But just the
same&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Toma will stay here. That&rsquo;s final. By
doing that, you can serve me better than by going
along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;In various ways. I could tell you better if I
knew exactly what is going to happen. I may not
capture Nichols at all; he may capture me. If he
does, there is the chance that you may be able to
rescue me. It may be that I am wrong too about
the outlaws being too astonished to fire at me while
I am crossing the clearing. If I am wrong, you
may be able to draw their fire and give me a chance
to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without once faltering, Corporal Rand struck
boldly out into the clearing and headed straight for
the wharf. His course would take him about forty
yards west of the warehouse on the side opposite
the door. The outlaws completely encircled the building.
Dick thought at first that it was their purpose
to unload the furs, placing them in the building,
but on second thought, he realized that this would
not be the case. With the yacht riding at anchor in
the inlet, it stood to reason that the furs would be
placed on the landing wharf, thereby saving a second
handling. In fact, the corporal had proceeded
scarcely twenty feet on his way, when Murky raised
one arm as a signal for the pack-train to come closer.
Fortunately, no one had as yet noticed the policeman.</p>
<p>Dick was rapidly losing control of his nerves.
The tension was terrible. He experienced a feeling
similar to that of being smothered under a blanket.
His gaze was fairly riveted on the retreating figure.
Every step that the corporal took positively
hurt him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment. He felt dizzy
and weak. He could hear Toma&rsquo;s breathing&mdash;choking
and asthmatic. He reached out and grabbed convulsively
for a branch that drooped down in front
of him. A wail of terror issued from his lips. A
crash, a puff of smoke! Corporal Rand stumbled a
little, as if his toe had caught in some obstruction
underfoot. Dick saw Murky wheel in surprise, his
hand fumbling at his belt, face white and tense.
But Rand had already pulled his gun and though
still thirty feet away, he had the drop on his opponent.
Murky&rsquo;s hand and those of the two sailors
went up, clawing the air. A few more steps, and
Rand stood amongst them.</p>
<p>Murky shrieked out something in Cree, which resulted
in immediate confusion around the warehouse.
Packers sprang to their ponies, whips cracked&mdash;hurried
calls and frenzied oaths. Figures darted
back and forth as though daft. Presently out of the
confusion came some semblance of order. The
pack-train started away in full retreat&mdash;a retreat
that was almost a rout.</p>
<p>Dick knew now what Murky&rsquo;s command had been:
Unable to save himself, only one chance was left him&mdash;to
send away the pack-train, to get rid of the
tell-tale evidence. Occupied as he was, Corporal
Rand was powerless to prevent it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The packers had drawn their guns and were herding
the ponies across the clearing, shouting hoarsely
at the top of their lungs. Dick saw Toma leap past
him, rifle held in readiness. For a split-second he stood
undecided, then he too turned and rushed frantically
away to head off the retreating party. Panting, they
circled around to the far side of the clearing, just
as the head of the column entered the woods. Toma&rsquo;s
rifle spurted fire and Dick followed his example.
The rout became a stampede. Ponies broke away
from their packers and rushed away at a mad gallop.
Dog teams snarled and fought. Taken completely by
surprise, the outlaws huddled together, firing volley
after volley at the place where the boys lay concealed.</p>
<p>From that time on, at least as far as Dick was
concerned, things became blurred, hazy&mdash;unreal.
Bullets flew in the brush everywhere. The pack-train
had stampeded, but the outlaws still remained.
Most of Murky&rsquo;s adherents had now taken to cover
and were offering a most stubborn resistance. It
was plain that Dick and Toma had failed in their
efforts.</p>
<p>There came suddenly a lull in the firing. In a
choked, excited voice, Dick spoke to Toma:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a terrible mess. We haven&rsquo;t succeeded in
accomplishing anything. First thing we know, one
of these outlaws will get a pot-shot at Rand&mdash;and
then all will be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal no fool,&rdquo; Toma replied. &ldquo;Things not
so bad what you think. Here come policeman now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>It was true. With the prisoners walking ahead of
him, Rand came straight toward the place of the recent
skirmish. This was the reason why the firing
had ceased. The outlaws were waiting for Murky.
As the policeman and his three prisoners came directly
opposite Dick heard Rand giving orders.
Then Nichols called out in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out of it, boys. It&rsquo;s all over. Come out,
I tell yuh. If any o&rsquo; yuh shoot, I&rsquo;m a dead man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One or two at a time, the outlaws came out,
dropped their guns and moved forward to Murky&rsquo;s
side, hands held high. Seeing the turn affairs had
taken, Dick and Toma also lost no time in joining
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Murky, I guess it&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; Rand stated
evenly. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seized your fur yet, but that
won&rsquo;t take long. Have you anything to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; at all, corporal,&rdquo; Nichols answered insolently.
&ldquo;But mebbe we ain&rsquo;t through yet&mdash;you an&rsquo;
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand ignored the threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can dispatch two of your men to overtake
the stampeded ponies and find the dog teams. Toma
will go along with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murky issued the orders, but the young guide
stepped forward and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men not all here, corporal. First time over at
warehouse I count six packers. Only four here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick confirmed Toma&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. There were six. I counted them
myself. We&rsquo;d better be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true, Murky?&rdquo; Rand scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? I wasn&rsquo;t here. Yuh oughta
know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be responsible if anything happens,&rdquo;
warned the policeman.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, Toma and two of the outlaws
went out in search of the stampeded ponies,
while Rand and Dick took the remaining men&mdash;with
the exception of the uniformed sailor and
Murky&mdash;and locked them in the warehouse. Then
Rand turned to the officer in charge of the yacht:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better order your vessel in, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but I don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo;
trembled the sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll save themselves a lot of trouble if they
do. I have the name and description of your vessel.
Remember you&rsquo;re dealing with the Canadian government
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the captain was right. Signalling from the
wharf proved of no avail. There came derisive
shouts from the men aboard, and not long afterward
the sailors hoisted the anchor and the yacht steamed
out of the inlet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">DICK GOES TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>The escape of the outlaws from the warehouse
during the night was one of those regrettable happenings
that come occasionally when least expected.
On the following morning as Dick opened the door
a deep silence greeted him. The prisoners had gone.
Investigation showed that part of the flooring had
been removed and that the outlaws had dug their
way out during the night. The shock of this discovery
staggered Dick, who lost no time in reporting
to Constable Rand. The policeman received the
news calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use worrying about it. I&rsquo;m
sorry, but it can&rsquo;t be helped. We have the ring-leaders&mdash;which
is much more important. The police
will retake the others in the course of time. Right
now, I&rsquo;m worrying more about Toma and the pack-ponies.
What has become of the fur? If we lose the
fur, we&rsquo;ll have no direct evidence against Murky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Dick in surprise, &ldquo;I should think you
could convict him easily. What about the shooting
of Pearly and the assault upon Richardson?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;True enough. But Murky didn&rsquo;t commit these
crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but he ordered them done. He&rsquo;s the person
responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, that may be rather hard to prove.
It all depends upon what attitude the other outlaws
take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The forenoon was long and tedious. Lines of
worry began to crease the corporal&rsquo;s forehead. Dick
was driven to the verge of desperation. The pack-train
had not yet returned. Sitting in front of the
campfire, opposite the sailor and Nichols, with Rand
pacing nervously back and forth behind him, Dick
pictured a hundred imaginary perils and disasters
that had befallen Toma. Sometimes he saw him
languishing in a dark, foul room, suffering all the
tortures of imprisonment; and again he visualized
a limp, lifeless form, crumpled in the snow in the
depth of some forest solitude, around him the leering,
grinning faces of the outlaws. By three o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon, Dick had become almost desperate.
He rose to his feet and drew the corporal
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t endure this much longer. Let&rsquo;s do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman took the younger man&rsquo;s arm affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; wailed Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing that I can propose&mdash;and
you may not like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can stay here and watch these two vultures
while I go out and try to find Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moisture had gathered in Dick&rsquo;s eyes. Through a
glistening film, he looked up at the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me go? This inactivity, this suspense
is killing me by inches. Corporal, I&rsquo;ll promise
to be very careful. But please let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dick, you can start. Take your blankets
and a few supplies&mdash;if you can find any. If you
have not discovered any trace of him by noon tomorrow,
come back and report to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick lost no time in making his departure. All
that afternoon he trudged through the snow, sometimes
picking up the track of a pony and losing it
again, on other occasions, coming across human
footprints or the charred remains of a campfire.
When darkness descended, he was miles back from
the coast, with nothing more encouraging to buoy
up his spirits than the thought that he must soon
reach the main-travelled trail. His aching legs carried
him along the slope of a hill&mdash;up, up interminably;
then he struck out north by east in the direction
he knew must eventually lead him to the place
he sought. But as the miles slipped past, he grew
so weary and footsore that he decided to make camp
for the night. Just ahead he could see what appeared
to be the edge of a coulee&mdash;and he struggled
on with the intention of entering it, thereby gaining
protection from the chill, moist wind that blew in
from the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Imagine his surprise, upon approaching closer,
to discover that it was not a coulee at all, but a deep-set
basin, looking somewhat like the ancient bed of
a lake. It was nearly three miles across, several hundred
feet deep, and thickly overgrown with red
willow. Near its center, he saw the twinkling light
of a cabin.</p>
<p>An hour later, he approached the cabin and
knocked timidly at the door. A squint-eyed native,
so old that his yellow face was a curious net-work
of wrinkles, admitted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want drink and food,&rdquo; Dick informed the man,
stumbling over the Indian words.</p>
<p>The old man nodded acquiescence, leading the way
into the house. He clapped his hands together
sharply and waited. From the loft above, there came
immediately the sound of shuffling feet, then a form,
even more senile than that of Dick&rsquo;s host, slowly
descended a rickety ladder, emitting as it came a
series of rheumatic groans. The woman, following
instructions from her husband and a half-timid stare
at Dick, hobbled into the adjoining room and returned
presently, carrying an earthern pot, which she
placed upon the floor in front of her visitor. It was
a cold but not unsavory mixture of fish and vegetables
and Dick, weak from hunger, carried the food
to a bench at one side of the room and began eating
with avidity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Thus far, he had not been successful in finding
any trace of Toma. Neither had he seen any of the
outlaws, although he was sure they must be somewhere
in the vicinity. Probably a few of them had
even passed by this cabin. Dick had learned a little
Cree and he decided to question the old Indian.
After several unsuccessful attempts, he finally gained
the information that a number of pack-horses, in
charge of three men, had crossed the basin only a
few hours previous.</p>
<p>Dick received the news with a joyous quickening
of the heart. From the native&rsquo;s description, Toma
was one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way were they travelling?&rdquo; came his next
eager question.</p>
<p>He expected, of course, to hear that they were
going east in search of the remainder of the ponies,
but to his surprise the Indian pointed westward.
This meant that he and Toma had passed each other
only a short time before. The guide, having completed
a successful search, was returning to the coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>It was cheering information and Dick decided that
as soon as he had finished his welcome repast and
had rested for a short time, he would retrace his
steps and rejoin his friends. Putting aside the
empty dish, he turned eagerly upon his host, just as
that worthy stepped back from his place by the door,
fear and dismay depicted in his watery old eyes.
Almost simultaneously, there fell across Dick&rsquo;s sensitive
ears the sound of approaching footsteps, then
a voice that caused him to experience a momentary
sensation of chill.</p>
<p>With a finger on his lips as a warning to the native,
Dick scurried up the ladder, pulling it up after
him. His hands were shaking. He deposited the ladder
on the floor, tiptoed across the loft and lay down
with his eyes at a crack.</p>
<p>The door of the room below was pushed rudely
open, without even the formality of a knock, and
three men&mdash;all of them outlaws&mdash;entered. Of the
three, one was a white man&mdash;the sailor who had
come ashore with the captain of the yacht. He wore
a gray cap and a much-soiled suit of clothes&mdash;apparel
too thin for that climate! He sat down shivering
close to the fireplace, extending his blue, unmittened
hands toward the blaze. He did not even look
up as one of the other outlaws called loudly for food
and growled unpleasantly when it did not appear
forthwith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>While they ate, Dick lay watching them. He hoped
that none of the outlaws would make a search of the
house. Even if they did&mdash;now that the ladder was
pulled up&mdash;he was fairly sure they would not come to
the loft. He was feeling comparatively safe, until
he became conscious of a step behind him. Then he
became panic-stricken. His tongue clove to the roof
of his mouth. He had hardly the strength to turn
his head as the apparition passed, a young Indian
girl not over seventeen or eighteen years of age. She
had paused, looked at him in a sort of bewildered
manner, then moved forward, picked up the ladder,
let it slip through the hole in the floor, and proceeded
to climb down to the room below.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s breath caught as he thought about the ladder
projecting there through the aperture, where the
Indian girl had left it. It was a strange trick of fate
that had been played upon him at a most inopportune
time. The outlaws now had easy access to the
loft. It would be simple enough indeed to come up
and take him like a rat in a trap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Also, there was another horn to the dilemma. Unwittingly,
the girl might blurt out something about
his presence there. And if she did, the outlaws would
hear it immediately and the game would be up. The
very imminence of the thing was not conducive to
Dick&rsquo;s peace of mind. Lying there, not daring to
stir, expecting at any moment to hear the ladder
creak under the weight of one or more of his enemies,
he sweated in an agony of apprehension. He
had left his rifle below and, unfortunately, his revolver
was empty. Desperately, he looked about him for
some sort of weapon that he might use in his own
defense. He could see nothing. Except for the blankets
in the far corner, the loft was bare. A small
pocket-knife was the only thing he had that would
be of the slightest service in a hand-to-hand encounter.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, one of the outlaws turned upon
the Indian woman and demanded more food. She
shook her head, informing him in Cree that there
was nothing more in the house. The outlaw apparently
did not believe this and, in a sudden burst of
anger, advanced and shook her roughly by the
shoulder.</p>
<p>The girl intervened. With a tiger-like spring, she
bounded forward, slapping him across the face. In
a blind fury now, he attempted to retaliate, but she
eluded him and ran to the center of the room. Here
he caught her, but released her with a snarl, as her
teeth sank into his arm. Eyes blazing, he grabbed
for her again, but she dodged past. His long fingers
caught in a string of beads, tearing it from her
neck. Then Dick&rsquo;s heart seemed to stand still. She
had started up the ladder, the outlaw in hot pursuit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>During the next few moments Dick&rsquo;s movements
were performed subconsciously&mdash;and with the speed
of desperation. The girl&rsquo;s head had appeared in
the aperture, when he jumped past her. Feet foremost,
he crashed into the repulsive up-turned face;
crashed into it, then went down&mdash;girl, outlaw and
ladder together&mdash;landing with a terrific impact that
shook the house.</p>
<p>Stunned, he and the girl separated themselves
from the confused muddle and struggled to their
feet. The outlaw, however, did not stir. When Dick
sprang forward and seized his rifle, the man still
lay there, one brown, claw-like hand still retaining
three or four unstrung beads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">A DUSKY FRIEND</span></h2>
<p>No sooner had Dick picked up his rifle than he
realized that he could not possibly escape the second
half-breed and the sailor who stood by the fireplace.
The odds were against him. The sailor had covered
him with an ugly-looking automatic, while the
breed&rsquo;s rifle was held at a threatening angle. He
put down his gun as quickly as he could, deciding to
face the situation squarely. Reaction from his first
spasm of fear had left him calm and cool, his mind
on the alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too many for me. I&rsquo;ll give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You showed a lot of good sense there,&rdquo; approved
the sailor. &ldquo;We sure would o&rsquo; drilled you, Buddy,
if you&rsquo;d made another move. Looks as if you&rsquo;d
done about enough damage now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick turned his head and looked again at the
crumpled form of the girl&rsquo;s assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry this had to happen. I guess he&rsquo;ll
recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing the hero stuff, eh?&rdquo; leered the sailor.
&ldquo;She ought to feel pretty proud o&rsquo; your work. I
must say you made a good job o&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Dick flushed, but did not reply. He was watching
the half-breed, who had advanced upon the old
Indian and had demanded a rope with which to bind
his prisoner. He saw the old man shake his head.
The watery old eyes, set in the curious net-work of
wrinkles, roved fearfully from face to face. Would
the outlaw please believe him? He spoke the truth.
God was his witness.</p>
<p>The half-breed considered the problem for a short
space, his crafty gaze darting here and there around
the room. In spite of his host&rsquo;s assertion to the
contrary, he was sure that the old man was not telling
the truth. He walked into the kitchen and came
back, shaking his head. He scrambled up to the
loft, where Dick heard him prowling around, muttering
to himself. He reappeared, at length, carrying
a thick woolen blanket, which he had taken from
the girl&rsquo;s bed. Producing a hunting knife, he cut
this into strips about two inches wide, and in a
short time had Dick bound as securely as if he had
used moosehide thongs or manilla rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind o&rsquo; hard on you, ain&rsquo;t it, Buddy,&rdquo; sympathised
the sailor. &ldquo;If it was me now, running this
show, I&rsquo;d let you go free. &rsquo;Cause we ain&rsquo;t got no
particular quarrel with you. But his nibs here seems
to think that you require special attention.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Dick and the sailor kept up a desultory conversation
for the next two or three hours, the sailor doing
most of the talking. He bitterly regretted the
circumstances that had brought him here. He spoke
contemptuously of his two companions. They were
not his sort. He liked neither of them. During the
day he had suffered from cold and exposure and had
undergone a terrible agony caused by blistered feet.
This was no country for a white man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had my wish right now, Buddy, I&rsquo;d be
aboard the &lsquo;Elenore,&rsquo; steamin&rsquo; down along the
coast,&rdquo; he declared presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have remained behind when the outlaws
broke out of the warehouse,&rdquo; Dick reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Stay there, an&rsquo; later on get throwed into
jail? I should say not. Even if I do have to suffer
now, I can mebbe make my way back to the States
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get you sooner or later,&rdquo; Dick argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so, but I&rsquo;ll take my chances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The room became more quiet. The old Indian
and his wife and daughter retired to the loft, leaving
the outlaws in full charge. The man, whom
Dick had hurt in his leap from the top of the ladder,
had recovered consciousness, but was as yet too
dazed and shaken to do more than lie groaning in
the corner, where he had been carried. His friend&mdash;he
who had bound Dick&mdash;paid little attention
either to this manifestation of suffering or to the
conversation between Dick and the sailor. In a
short time he had begun to drowse, chin on his chest,
eyes half open. With a friendly nod to Dick, the
sailor rose from his place by the fire, and, using
his coat as a pillow, lay down upon the hard
floor.</p>
<p>Two candles furnished light for the room. One
had been placed on a shelf on the wall, the other on
a small table by the door, leading to the kitchen.
Except for the ruddy glare from the fireplace, there
was no other light. When the other occupants of
the room had fallen asleep, Dick rolled restlessly
from side to side. Occasionally, his gaze fell upon
the candles. Both had burned low, now flickering
and fluttering eerily. The shadows deepened.
When he awoke, following a fitful nap, one of the
candles had gone out. The fire also had burned low.
Its feeble red glow cast a weird and ghastly shaft of
light across the floor. As Dick turned his face to
the wall, the remaining taper sputtered and burned
down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Again sleep claimed him&mdash;this time deep and unbroken
for several hours. He was startled into
wakefulness by a loud banging at the door. A
match flared through the darkness, footsteps
sounded across the floor, the bolt was slid back to
admit two muffled forms. The two newcomers,
accompanied by the man who had bound Dick,
strode over to the fireplace and piled on more fuel.
In the ruddy glow that sprang up shortly afterward,
Dick recognized them both&mdash;two more of the packers
who had escaped from the warehouse.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour, the three jabbered unabatingly
in Cree. Dick was able to understand a good
deal of what was said. He followed their long,
rambling discourse with increasing interest. Here
was news indeed! A plot! The eavesdropper
caught his breath, felt his pulses leap quickly.</p>
<p>They proposed on the following morning to set out
for the warehouse to rescue Murky and the others.
But it was more than a mere rescue. It was to be
an ambuscade. From different directions they
would creep up within rifle range of the policeman
and, when the first opportunity presented itself,
would riddle his body with bullets. Later on, they
would shoot Toma. As soon as Murky had been
released, they would recover the fur and travel
south.</p>
<p>Then, with a start, Dick heard them mention him.
He too would meet the same fate as the others&mdash;only
much sooner. Was it not a tedious business to
drag along a prisoner? Much more simple to dispatch
him with a knife or bullet before starting.
Anyway, it was no more serious an offense to kill
three men than two. The punishment would be
the same if they got caught. But that was unthinkable.
They would escape easily this time. It would
be very simple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is not all this true, brothers?&rdquo; inquired the chief
conspirator.</p>
<p>There came guttural assent. Emphatic nods of
confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything to eat in the house of this
doddering old spy?&rdquo; one of the newcomers wished
to know.</p>
<p>The answer came in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They proceeded to do this with a celerity that
was astonishing. Soon their heavy snoring rumbled
across the stillness of the room.</p>
<p>The hours passed slowly, seeming interminable.
Dick slept by fits and starts. Once he awoke, conscious
of a strange feeling. Had he heard someone
moving about? He lay very still, endeavoring to
catch the sound again, but although he listened for a
long time, it was not repeated. He was almost
asleep again when soft footfalls issued from the
loft. A faint cushion-like tread, a creak of the ladder,
then a vague form groping about the room.</p>
<p>The person, whoever it was, paused and remained
perfectly still for several tense moments. Again the
soft footfalls. Another pause. The ghostly visitor
was getting closer now&mdash;almost within reach of
Dick&rsquo;s arm, had he been able to use it. The figure
advanced another step; a hand groped forth experimentally.
Dick&rsquo;s heart almost stopped beating.
Dark as it was, he caught the gleam of a knife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The Indian girl! A surge of elation swept over
him. She stooped down and a moment later his
bonds were cut. He was free! It seemed incredible.
He was free! He could move his numb and
aching limbs. Under the stress of a great emotion,
he reached up and patted his rescuer&rsquo;s soft cheek.
Just then he could have shed tears of happiness.</p>
<p>Not even a whisper had passed between them.
The girl pressed the knife in his hand, and then, to
his utter astonishment, a bulky object, which he
knew immediately was his own automatic. Abruptly
she left him. The soft footfalls across the floor,
the faint creak of the ladder, a rustle in the loft
above&mdash;followed by a deep, unearthly silence. Dick
lay, eyes open wide, staring out across the room.
The girl had not been heard. The whilom packers
still slept, as their deep breathing attested. His
chance had come!</p>
<p>He sat up cautiously, his gaze turned in the direction
of the door. It was about twelve feet away.
To reach it, it would be necessary to pass the sleeping
form of the half-breed who had bound him.
Trembling, he arose, feeling his way ahead but had
gone only a few steps when he stopped short in
uncertainty. No longer could he hear the man&rsquo;s
deep breathing. Was he awake? Fully five minutes
passed before Dick again essayed to move, to dare
take the risk. Then, gaining more confidence, he
tiptoed straight to the door, one hand reaching out to
shoot the bolt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Two spurts of flame stabbed the dark, a hurtling
form missed him by a scant three inches as he
swung open the door. He leaped outside and
started away on a run. The wind tore at his
clothes. His parka slipped from his head and fell
to the ground. Through the smothering obscurity
of the night he raced wildly, in his terror imagining
that he could hear plainly the patter of footsteps behind.
Never once did he slacken his speed until he
had reached the foot of the slope, leading up from
the ancient bed of the lake. Here he stopped short,
choking for breath, listening fearfully for the sound
of his pursuers.</p>
<p>Dick did not deceive himself in believing that no
attempt would be made to recapture him. Even
now the outlaws had probably left the cabin and
were in swift pursuit. He paused in the shelter of
a bush to strike a match and consult his watch. To
his surprise, it was now nearly six o&rsquo;clock. Dawn
would soon break and it behooved him to put as
many miles between him and his pursuers, as
possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>He went on through the pitchy darkness that
obscured the earth. He had a fair sense of direction,
but at length he became confused. For all he
knew, he might be travelling miles off his course.
When the first faint light of day streaked the east,
he paused in dismay. His fears were confirmed.
He had been walking south instead of west, and it
would be necessary to retrace his steps. His heart
was heavy as he turned to the right and struck off
through a wilderness of rocks and trees that encompassed
him on every side.</p>
<p>Daylight found him on the shore of a small
river, not yet frozen over, whose icy waters cascaded
down from the hills. He knew that if he followed
this stream, it would lead him eventually to the
ocean. He struggled on, conscious of fatigue and
hunger. His feet were blistered and sore. His
clothing was torn. An unexpected fall on a slippery
rock had wrenched his right wrist, causing him
excruciating pain. He was moving slowly along,
wondering how much farther he would be compelled
to go before he reached the coast, when a tall
figure stepped out from its concealment of rocks,
less than fifty yards ahead. It was one of the
outlaws.</p>
<p>For a time despair choked him. Then he jumped
quickly to cover and hurried back over the selfsame
route he had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A GAME OF HIDE-AND-SEEK</span></h2>
<p>During the next few hours, Dick engaged in a
grim and desperate game of hide-and-seek with the
outlaws. On several occasions he escaped death narrowly.
He turned hither and thither, like a hunted
animal, only to find his path barred by one or more
of his enemies. Finally, in a last despairing effort
to save himself, he struck off toward a high hill, on
the crest of which were lofty rocks and towering
pinnacles&mdash;broken and jagged slabs of granite. Here
he would make his stand. Even though surrounded, he
would have a chance to ward off attack. If necessary,
he would remain here all day and make another
break for freedom with the coming of darkness.</p>
<p>Climbing up, he reached the natural fortress and
breathed a sigh of relief. He had neither food nor
water. From a bush, which grew in a crevice in
the rocks, he gathered fuel with which to start a
fire. Then he sat down to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>In all his experience, he had never suffered more
than upon this occasion. His stomach gnawed with
hunger. He shook from exhaustion. Bareheaded,
moccasins almost cut from his feet, clothing soiled
and tattered, hands and face scratched&mdash;his appearance
beggared description. His cheeks were hollow,
while his eyes shone with a feverish, almost insane
light.</p>
<p>After two hours of inaction, squatting miserably
in front of his fire, he began to wonder if, after all,
the outlaws had not abandoned the chase. In an
effort to find out, he slipped gingerly over his barricade
and scrambled down to the ledge below. He
could command a good view here. His eyes roved
the surrounding woodland. Everywhere he looked&mdash;but
he could see no one. The silence was intense,
deep, a sort of rhythmical beat pulsating through
dead space under the vast dome of the sky.</p>
<p>His heart leaping with joy, he decided to quit his
post and resume his journey. But something made
him hesitate. An almost indiscernible movement
along the slope below attracted his attention. He
ducked quickly. A bullet whistled over his head.
Angry and disappointed, he climbed back to the
safety of the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>How he would ever manage to endure the long
and tedious wait for the coming of night, he did not
know. The strain was so great that he decided
more than once to walk boldly out and give himself
up. Even death was preferable to this. Time after
time, he rose and with bloodshot eyes stared out
toward the west&mdash;to the broad, green expanse of the
Pacific. If only Corporal Rand or Toma knew of
his trouble, they would come to him. Sometimes,
sitting moodily, chin resting in his hands, he thought
of Sandy back at Settlement Mountain and wished
that he were with him. Why had he been so eager
to come in pursuit of the pack-train?</p>
<p>Night came as slowly as a limping beggar to a
gate. Shadows deepened. Strange silhouettes appeared
along the slope. Not a breath of wind stirred
the trees below. The sounds of the forest were
buried in the evening&rsquo;s hush.</p>
<p>One hour more&mdash;and he would make his final
break for safety. Impatiently, he rose and began
pacing back and forth in the narrow, confining
space, swinging his numb arms against his shivering
body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dick&rsquo;s hand went to his automatic in a
quick, convulsive movement. But he did not draw
his gun. Instead, he grinned sheepishly, staring at
the dusky face which peered up from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he sang out.</p>
<p>The Indian girl smiled and clambered up to the
perch beside him. She spoke in Cree:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not see me come. I will help you.
Does monsieur know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>With the few Indian words at his disposal, Dick
endeavored to explain his case. He admitted that
he had become confused. He could see the ocean,
but it was still a long way off. In an attempt to
escape his pursuers, he had been forced to travel in
the wrong direction. How far was he now from
her home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very close,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;If it were
not for the heavy woodland just over there, in the
light you would be able to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find out I was here?&rdquo; queried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your enemies,&rdquo; the girl answered unhesitatingly.
&ldquo;One of them came to my father&rsquo;s house a
short time ago and asked for food. I overheard
him tell my father that you had sought concealment
on this hill. So I came at once to help you, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the outlaws now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is hiding in the tree below, waiting for you
to come out. Very soon this one will be joined by
the man who went to see my father. Three others
have gone down to the coast to intercept you, should
you escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say that your home is
not very far from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, monsieur. Less than two miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two miles! Dick&rsquo;s mouth set in a grim, hard
line. All day long he had been scrambling, struggling,
fighting his way through trees and underbrush,
over tortuous rocks&mdash;and yet had proceeded
no farther than that. The thought galled him, made
him feel a little foolish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The girl spoke again. In her excitement, she
spoke so rapidly now that he found it almost impossible
to understand her. However, there was one
word she emphasized, frequently reiterated. The
boat! She would lead him thither. Monsieur
would row the boat. She knew exactly where to
find it. His escape would be certain. They must
hurry before the other outlaw came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She intends to accompany me all the way to the
coast,&rdquo; thought Dick, a flush of embarrassment suffusing
his cheeks.</p>
<p>He attempted to voice a protest, exhausting his
complete stock of words in an endeavor to make her
understand. But to no avail. She repeated the
word, pointing away to the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat is three miles from here. I will take
you there,&rdquo; she explained to him.</p>
<p>The fugitive scratched his head in perplexity.
What did she mean? A boat three miles away.
Why, there wasn&rsquo;t even water over there. The
ocean lay to the west&mdash;ten or twelve miles distant.
The thing was absurd, preposterous!</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, there came to him a glimmering
of the truth. He thought he knew now. She referred,
no doubt, to some sort of navigable stream,
along the shore of which was moored a boat, belonging
to her father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>With a nod to the girl that he understood and
was ready to start, he jumped quickly to the level
surface of the rocks above, took her hand and
helped her down to the ledge. From there they set
out through the rapidly gathering darkness. An
hour later, without mishap, they pushed their way
through the pines to the edge of a wide stream,
where, sure enough, they found the boat. Hurriedly,
Dick made ready for his departure. Arctic
night had fallen. Above them, through a rift in the
heavy clouds, a few faint stars were visible.</p>
<p>He turned for a last look at the little Indian girl
who had brought him there. A few yards away
she proceeded through the pines and presently her
dark silhouette became lost to view. With a slight
constriction of the throat, Dick swung about and
pushed off, his pulses quickening again at the
thought of the danger which might lay ahead. In
two hours he had floated along the swift current and
had entered a narrow arm of the sea.</p>
<p>Thus far he had drifted leisurely along, every
sense alert, endeavoring to make as little noise as
possible. If he could negotiate a mile or two from
shore he would feel comparatively safe. After that
there was little likelihood that the outlaws would
ever overtake him. Paddling north, he would enter
the inlet. He hoped he would arrive in time to
warn Corporal Rand and Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>As the minutes went by, hope grew in his breast.
Conditions, he perceived, were ideal for his escape&mdash;almost
complete darkness and a stretch of smooth
water ahead. Every little while he paused to look
around in apprehension. Once, with a quick start,
he thought he had heard something. Paddle raised,
he permitted the boat to drift for a moment or two,
panic in his heart. But the sound was not repeated.</p>
<p>Pursuit, he felt, would come from behind; the
outlaws might secure boats somewhere and attempt
to overtake him. Looking for pursuit from the
shore, he was wholly unprepared for what actually
happened. A little later, just as he had begun to
believe that he was out of danger, unexpectedly
through the velvety gloom that had settled about
him, ahead&mdash;not behind&mdash;there loomed a shape, a
dark smear across his troubled vision.</p>
<p>It was so close that escape seemed absolutely out
of the question. Notwithstanding this, Dick turned
and started back. Frantically his paddle cut the water
for ten or fifteen yards, then a guttural voice
rang out and immediately the night became a medley
of sound; rifles cracked forth, oars splashed, vivid
spurts of red flame flashed through the dark, while
all around him the water hissed and sputtered where
struck the lead from Murky&rsquo;s murderous crew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>A bullet whistled close to his ear. Another tore
through the loose sleeve of his coat. At this juncture,
he dropped his paddle, and, in an effort to retrieve
it, nearly capsized. As he came back to a
sitting position, his craft rocking perilously, a small
piece of wood, torn from the side of the boat, struck
him full in the mouth. Dazed, he put up one hand
to his face, feeling the warm blood trickling down
through his fingers.</p>
<p>In desperation, Dick abandoned all hope of escape,
deciding to sell his life as dearly as possible. Revolver
in hand, he crouched in the stem. The outlaws&rsquo;
boat was closer now, sweeping down upon him
at top speed. He had barely time to empty his revolver
at the oncoming craft before it crashed into
him. They had deliberately run him down. He was
in the icy water now, coughing, choking, attempting
to dodge the bullets of the half-breeds by diving under
the surface.</p>
<p>It would be more difficult to see him now. He
would fight to the last. Thank God, he could swim!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE INVALID</span></h2>
<p>Strong arms raised him up and carried him
tenderly along the beach as one might have carried
a child. Anxious eyes peered down at the placid
face; voices, subdued and solicitous, murmured
around him. Near at hand, the river fretted against
its shores, its gurgling song more melancholy than
the plaintive dirge of the pines.</p>
<p>Wading ashore, following his last encounter
with the outlaws, Dick had collapsed, and, when
found later by the rescue party, lay with his feet
in the water and his arms flung out above his head.
At first, they had believed him dead. No senseless,
inanimate thing cast up by the sea, ever presented
a more bedraggled appearance. The stubborn spark
of life, which still glowed feebly within him, was
not manifest. Corporal Rand, who had elected to
carry him back to the shelter of trees, where Toma
had already kindled a fire, could have sworn that
his young friend had fought his last fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>The sound of firing had carried to the inlet, and
had been the cause of much concern and conjecture
on the part of Dick&rsquo;s companions. Both surmised
that the youthful adventurer was in trouble and they
had come expecting to find him in some tight corner,
hotly besieged, yet valiantly holding his own. They
were wholly unprepared and not a little mystified,
when after a painstaking search, they finally
stumbled upon his body.</p>
<p>Neither could explain how Dick had come there
nor exactly what had happened to him. The nearest
approach to a reasonable solution was that Dick
in some unaccountable manner had been knocked
unconscious and then thrown into the water&mdash;left
there by the outlaws to drown. The cold plunge
had partly revived him and he had contrived somehow
to swim or crawl ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he&rsquo;ll live,&rdquo; Rand&rsquo;s voice was sepulchral.</p>
<p>For hours they employed restorative measures.
Toma went back to the warehouse to fetch a blanket.
They chafed his limbs; built up a huge bonfire;
worked desperately over him. Just before morning
Dick lay in a comatose state, his pulse more steady,
his condition considerably improved. Faint color
began to tinge his cheeks. After a time, his eyes
opened dazedly and with much wrinkling and puckering
of his brow he endeavored to fill in his gaps
of memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Wraiths and shadows of once familiar things
drifted across his mental vision. Through the
darkness and obscurity of his mind, not in orderly
sequence, but in a provoking, mysterious fashion,
there flashed haphazardly half-familiar scenes of the
past.</p>
<p>Toma, stooping to smooth back the rumpled hair,
glanced sombrely at the policeman opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think him better?&rdquo; he demanded in a
strained, cracked voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; answered the corporal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I glad to hear that. You think pretty soon we
be able to move him over to warehouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;but not yet. He&rsquo;s still too dazed and
weak. He needs rest and quiet. But he&rsquo;s doing
nicely.&rdquo;,</p>
<p>They left him while they went to prepare breakfast.
When Toma returned to the place where the
patient lay, he was greeted with a wan smile of
recognition. The Indian lad cried out jubilantly.
Hearing him, Rand rushed over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the good Lord you&rsquo;re coming round,&rdquo;
he cried out. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how happy
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>They made Dick a light broth and towards noon
he was feeling so well he was able to sit up. Always
there was one of the two near him. They were
compelled to make frequent trips to and from the
warehouse. In addition to caring for Dick, they
had the prisoners to look after. On the previous
night, before starting out, they had bound the four
men hand and foot. There were now extra meals
to prepare, increasing responsibility. The larder
required replenishing. During his spare time, Toma
went out to hunt for rabbits and ptarmigan.</p>
<p>Shortly before two o&rsquo;clock, the policeman, who
had been busy gathering fuel for the fire, came over
and sat down by Dick&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel strong enough now to tell me all
about it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;How did you get here? How
many of the outlaws were in the party which attacked
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I do that,&rdquo; Dick spoke up, rubbing one
shaky hand across his forehead, &ldquo;I want to warn
you, corporal, that those packers may return. They
were planning to rescue Murky and the others and to
murder you and Toma. It&rsquo;s queer they haven&rsquo;t
already come. You must be very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure about this, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;An ambuscade! A
treacherous, cowardly thing! They planned to
secrete themselves in the brush and take pot-shot at
you. Later, when they had released Murky and
the prisoners, they intended to go south with the
fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dick recounted his adventures. When he
had finished, the corporal exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly had your share of trouble. It
must have been a terrible ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>He rose hesitatingly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you think that I am inconsiderate if I leave
you for a time alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; quickly responded the invalid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
all right. Don&rsquo;t worry about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Rand hesitated, &ldquo;after what you&rsquo;ve
told me, I feel a little apprehensive. I must go over
and warn Toma. The warehouse will be the point
of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick smiled weakly. &ldquo;Certainly, go ahead. It&rsquo;s
the only thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand threw more wood on the fire and departed.
It was nearly two hours before he returned. The
moment Dick saw him, he noted immediately that
a marked change had come over the policeman. He
was more lighthearted than before. He smiled frequently.
He joked and laughed, regaling Dick with
stories of the service&mdash;amusing anecdotes and
breathless escapades. While he was preparing lunch,
he looked up and grinned across at Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be sorry when this thing is over
and we return to Fort Good Faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed outright. &ldquo;Well, not exactly,
although I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed the experience for
anything. By the way, corporal, how much of the
fur did you recover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. Then all that remains to be done
is to capture the four packers and the sailor. Do
you think we&rsquo;ll be able to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Rand, &ldquo;I have two young but very
capable assistants. Tomorrow you&rsquo;ll be on your feet
again, while Toma is feeling as fit as a fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma is wonderful,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;You can
always rely on him. I don&rsquo;t believe he knows what
fear means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; approved the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d make
an exceptionally good scout, a splendid partner for
Malemute Slade. He may get the chance too. When
the Inspector receives my report, there&rsquo;ll be several
persons I know who&rsquo;ll receive laudatory mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick gazed dreamily into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they may send Toma to the training barracks
at Regina this winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very probably&mdash;and another young man,
too, if he cares to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean me?&rdquo; gasped Dick, blinking suddenly,
a queer tugging at his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s within the realm of reason,&rdquo; Rand
looked up mischievously. &ldquo;But are you sure you
haven&rsquo;t had enough of this sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, corporal, I&rsquo;d like to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t an easy life,&rdquo; Rand informed him. &ldquo;The
pay is small. One never knows what tomorrow
may bring forth. Your greatest reward will be the
satisfaction of knowing that you have strived to do
your duty. If I were you, I&rsquo;d think long and
seriously before I took the step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you took it. Do you mean to say that you
regret your move? Would you change places with
someone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal&rsquo;s face had become very sober. He
too stared dreamily into the fire. In the steel-gray
eyes was a look Dick had never seen before. There
was a catch in the policeman&rsquo;s voice when he spoke
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to think about that now. I&rsquo;ve
crossed my Rubicon. It was my own choice&mdash;but
I&rsquo;m not sorry. I think I&rsquo;ve run the gamut of human
emotion. I&rsquo;ve experienced every phase of physical
suffering. On the other hand, there have been
times when the mere joy of living paramounted
every other thing. The rugged life that we lead
gets into the blood. Even if I should return to
civilization, I doubt very much whether I would
ever be happy or satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick smiled reminiscently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me of what Sergeant Richardson
told me about a year ago, just before he received
his promotion. He said that there were times when
he gloried in the service; at other times he positively
hated it. When he first came to this region,
the Inspector sent him out to arrest an Eskimo murderer.
It took him eight months. In all that time
never once did he see the face of a white man. The
memory of that exploit still haunts him. He
weighed a hundred and seventy-eight pounds when
he set out on that trip and one hundred and fifty
when he returned with his prisoner. All that remained
of his uniform was his service hat. His
hair and beard were so long that he looked like a
wild man. Habit was so strong that when the Inspector
addressed him, he answered in Eskimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Rand laughed, but made no comment.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, Toma appeared. His usually
expressionless face radiated good nature. He too
seemed to be very happy. He sat down in front
of the fire, pulled an harmonica out of his pocket
and commenced to play. Rand leaned back against
a convenient tree trunk and filled and lit his pipe.
As time passed, Dick began to wonder if it were
good policy to leave the prisoners so long alone.
Under no circumstances, ought they to trust Murky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the prisoners be all right, corporal?&rdquo; Dick
finally blurted out. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there danger that one of
them may become untied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rand shook his head complacently and winked
covertly at Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I&rsquo;ve caught you, corporal. Something
has happened. Have the prisoners already escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they still here,&rdquo; Toma denied the allegation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Dick was not convinced. Although the high
spirits of his two companions belied the supposition,
he could not help feeling that something was amiss.
The more he thought about it, the more perplexed
he became. It was not like Corporal Rand to be
so careless. Surely experience had taught him better
than this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I think you must be keeping
something from me. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman feigned annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken. I can&rsquo;t remember that I&rsquo;ve
ever given you cause to say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invalid flushed and averted his gaze. He had
been sitting up, wrapped in blankets, his shoulders
resting against a tree. Just then he felt sheepish
and wished that he had held his tongue. He was
depressed. But his mood changed suddenly&mdash;first to
amazement, then to joy. He raised one trembling
hand and rubbed his eyes. One long, glad cry
rang from his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">CAMPFIRE SMOKE</span></h2>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes were shining as Sandy strode up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last person on earth I expected to see!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;When did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few hours ago,&rdquo; replied Sandy, releasing
Dick&rsquo;s hand and standing up to look curiously about
him. &ldquo;Corporal Rand was over at the warehouse
when we arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you think I came alone? Sergeant
Richardson and I left Settlement Mountain a week
ago, and I want to tell you we&rsquo;ve made quick time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what did you do with your prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took them back to Wandley&rsquo;s post. Had &rsquo;em
locked up. While we were there we saw Pearly.
He&rsquo;s very much improved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Well, how
did you like the trip? I suppose you had difficulty
in finding the entrance to Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were afraid we would, but fortunately everything
turned out all right. You see, Dick, there
hasn&rsquo;t been a heavy snow storm since that day we
started out with Pearly. We were able to follow
your tracks most of the way. The only place, where
we had any trouble at all, was just east of that long
ravine. Here the wind had drifted in your trail.
We were delayed several hours before we found it
again&mdash;about a mile farther on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m anxious to see Sergeant Richardson. How
is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As fit as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There ensued a short interval of silence. Sandy
gazed down at his chum, sympathy and commiseration
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve had a pretty tough time of it. Do
you think you&rsquo;ll be able to be around soon? Over
at the warehouse, Toma told me all about your experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the memory, Dick&rsquo;s face shadowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t care to go through it all again. I&rsquo;m
glad you weren&rsquo;t here, Sandy. You might not have
been so fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy grinned to himself. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve had a
few exciting moments ourselves. Early this morning
we discovered the packers. I suppose Rand told
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Packers! What do you mean? Both the corporal
and Toma have been as secretive as clams.
But once or twice I almost caught them. Tell me
about it, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Scotchman pulled forward a block of
wood and sat down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a very long story, Dick. I think our
meeting with the packers was as much a surprise to
us as it was to them. You see, all day yesterday
we had been hurrying along, anxious to get down
here to the coast. We were not sure where we
would find you. Sergeant Richardson was always
looking for the smoke of a campfire. When we were
still ten or twelve miles back along the trail, every
chance he got he&rsquo;d climb some hill and scan the surrounding
country with his field-glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed several cabins, but he thought it would
be better not to make inquiries there. Last night,
just before we made camp, he shinned up a tall tree
and looked everywhere. He thought he could see
the distant glow of a fire, but he was not sure. This
morning we rose early. It was still dark when we
started out. Sergeant Richardson was in the lead.
When daylight came, I remember he turned to tell
me that we were not more than four miles from the
ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy paused and smiled reminiscently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long after that we smelled smoke. It was
faint, yet one could detect the odor. The sergeant
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re pretty close to them now, Sandy. When
we find the source of this smoke, I think we&rsquo;ll find
them.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little farther on, we saw a blue spiral, twisting
and curling up among the trees. We were very close
now. Naturally, I was very anxious to see you all
again, and started forward on a run, but the sergeant
overtook me, seizing me by the collar. He yanked
me into the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was unduly cautious. He warned
me to be quiet, to follow him. We advanced toward
that smoke spiral as stealthily as a couple of Bengal
tigers. I&rsquo;m here to tell you, Dick, that I&rsquo;m mighty
glad now that we did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can imagine our surprise. Not you
at all&mdash;not any of you! Instead four dirty half-breeds
and a queer-looking duffer of a white man.
I was disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t have the least idea who
they were, and supposed, of course, that we would
leave them and proceed on our journey. I recall
plucking at the sergeant&rsquo;s sleeve and whispering
something about hurrying along on our way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for some reason, Richardson was suspicious.
He instructed me to remain there while he crawled
closer. The men were eating their breakfast and
talking amongst themselves. Richardson wanted to
hear what they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was annoyed over the delay. I wasn&rsquo;t the least
bit interested in those half-breeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re just wasting valuable time,&rsquo; I told myself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;After a time, a rabbit hopped up close to where I
was sitting and I became interested in him. I had
just chucked a piece of bark at him, when I heard a
sudden commotion. Someone was talking in a loud
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the sergeant. There he stood with a gun
in his hands, bawling out orders. The half-breeds
and the funny duffer in the gray cap were huddled
in front of him like a flock of frightened sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that they were
Murky&rsquo;s packers. I guess I was a little bewildered.
The thing had happened so suddenly. I heard Richardson
calling me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the white man who told us the story. He
said he was sick of the whole business and was ready
to quit. He said he hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong
anyway, but even if he had, he preferred jail to
another day in that wilderness. He was only a common
sailor, he told us, and would be mighty glad to
get back to his ship. Until just recently, neither he
nor any of the other sailors knew that the fur had
been stolen. Captain Reynolds, master of the yacht,
had told them a very plausible story and they had
believed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy paused again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much more to tell. We reached the
warehouse less than an hour later, where we found
Corporal Rand and his prisoners. Maybe you think
I wasn&rsquo;t glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick looked up into his chum&rsquo;s face and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad too. This surely came as a surprise to
me. It won&rsquo;t be long now until we can return to
Fort Good Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy rose to his feet. He stretched his arms
above his head, yawning lazily. Suddenly his hands
dropped and he stared in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Dick! Here comes Sergeant Richardson.
He&rsquo;s bringing all the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">MURKY&rsquo;S CONFESSION</span></h2>
<p>Murky Nichols was a changed man. His spirit
had been broken. No longer he assumed his defiant
attitude, his blustering, cock-sure manner. His sins
had found him out. He had been caught in the toils
of the long-reaching arm of the police.</p>
<p>Whenever he was spoken to, he answered in monosyllables.
For the most part, he sat brooding, eyes
downcast, tormented by his thoughts. A short time
before the police party prepared for its departure, he
stirred from his lethargy and beckoned to Sergeant
Richardson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a few things I&rsquo;d like to tell yuh. I know
what yuh all think&mdash;that I&rsquo;ve always been a bad egg
an&rsquo; a crook. Yuh believe I&rsquo;ve been runnin&rsquo; stolen
fur through to the coast here fer a good many years.
But that ain&rsquo;t the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the truth?&rdquo; inquired Richardson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, Sergeant, I&rsquo;d like tuh ask yuh a question.
How long do yuh think it&rsquo;s been since I found out
about the pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine, Murky. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight years,&rdquo; replied the outlaw. &ldquo;It was eight
years ago that I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh,&rdquo; drawled Nichols. &ldquo;It was me. I was
prospectin&rsquo; then an&rsquo;, whether yuh believe it or not.
I&rsquo;d always been honest&mdash;never done a wrong thing.
It was in the spring o&rsquo; the year. I&rsquo;d been havin&rsquo;
some hard luck the previous summer, pannin&rsquo; gold
up along the Lobstick River. I was broke all the
followin&rsquo; winter an&rsquo; when spring come Wandley
staked me to a grubstake fer another try at gettin&rsquo;
back what I&rsquo;d lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durin&rsquo; the winter I had talked with an ol&rsquo; Indian,
who used to live on Settlement River. He told me
that about twenty years before a white prospector
had made a big strike in the foothills west o&rsquo; Settlement
Mountain. I decided to go there, though as a
usual thing I don&rsquo;t put much stock in these yarns o&rsquo;
the Nitchies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So jus&rsquo; before the first big thaw, I slips out there,
while the frost is still in the ground an&rsquo; builds me a
small shack. Mebbe yuh saw it&mdash;a little way back
from the ravine that yuh come into before reachin&rsquo;
the pass. Well, I prospected through that country
an&rsquo; one day I struck it rich. Nothin&rsquo; very big, sergeant,
but it looked good to me then. I had nearly
two thousand in gold by midsummer. I was able to
square my account with Wandley, an&rsquo; I had a nice
little nest egg to keep me goin&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;One day, lookin&rsquo; for new pockets, I slipped down
into the ravine an&rsquo; begins to follow it up. I kept
movin&rsquo; westward an&rsquo; after a while I reached the end
an&rsquo; saw that big crevice in the rock. Bein&rsquo; kind o&rsquo;
curious, I walked through an&rsquo; came out into the
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gloomy face of the big prospector brightened
perceptibly. He paused, mumbling to himself. Just
then he was living in the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first, I couldn&rsquo;t hardly believe what I seen.
Here was a big valley in the very heart o&rsquo; the mountains.
I remembered the ol&rsquo; Nitchie yarn about
Blind Man&rsquo;s Pass. I began wonderin&rsquo; if this was it.
I made up my mind that it wouldn&rsquo;t do no harm to
investigate. I spent two weeks out there an&rsquo; finally
when I went back to Wandley&rsquo;s, I had a secret. I
knew that &rsquo;most everybody would be glad to hear the
good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first man I see at Wandley&rsquo;s is O&rsquo;Connell.
He&rsquo;s been busy all summer freightin&rsquo; supplies. I
guess he&rsquo;d about cornered ever&rsquo; available pack-horse
in the country. Him an&rsquo; Hart, &rsquo;count o&rsquo; the bad
condition of the trails, wasn&rsquo;t makin&rsquo; very good
headway. O&rsquo;Connell tells me he has thousands o&rsquo;
pounds to take out, an&rsquo; no way to do it. He has a
big shipment ready to send &rsquo;round to the coast but
don&rsquo;t durst tackle it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which way yuh going?&rsquo; I asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yellowhead Pass,&rsquo; he answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kind o&rsquo; long trip,&rsquo; I says.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yeh, it sure is,&rsquo; O&rsquo;Connell shoot back. &lsquo;An&rsquo; I
dread it. The trails down that way is mighty near
impassable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was jus&rsquo; on the tip o&rsquo; my tongue to tell him
about my discovery, when somethin&rsquo; makes me
change my mind. There&rsquo;d be nothin&rsquo; in it fer me if
I tells what I knew, an&rsquo; besides I figgered I ought to
be paid fer all the trouble I&rsquo;d been put to. So I says
to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O&rsquo;Connell, what&rsquo;ll yuh give me if I take that
stuff through fer yuh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t answer right away, &rsquo;cause he thought
I was jokin&rsquo;. He winked at Wandley an&rsquo; laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yuh wouldn&rsquo;t get very far,&rsquo; he tells me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mebbe not,&rsquo; I says to him, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to
take the chance. Jus&rsquo; name your price.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If yuh really mean it,&rsquo; O&rsquo;Connell gasps, &lsquo;yuh
can have the whole blamed contract an&rsquo; good luck to
yuh. The summer rains have made the trails so
bad that I won&rsquo;t be able to get through fer another
month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked an&rsquo; figgered fer a while an&rsquo; finally I
gets the contract. I&rsquo;m to get nine hundred dollars
an&rsquo; keep seven hundred fer myself. I could tell by
the way he acted that he thought he&rsquo;d beat me pretty
bad in the deal. So did everybody else. They was
all laughin&rsquo; up their sleeves, thinkin&rsquo; about what a
fool I had made o&rsquo; myself. Wandley calls me to
one side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Murky,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;yuh jus&rsquo; made a hasty contract.
Yuh better change your mind before it&rsquo;s too
late. You&rsquo;ll lose all the money yuh made up in the
hills this summer an&rsquo; mebbe a lot more besides.
O&rsquo;Connell knows he can&rsquo;t make a cent on that west
coast shipment, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re playin&rsquo; right in his hands.
Yuh better see him now before he leaves an&rsquo; tell him
you&rsquo;ve changed your mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What would you like to bet I can&rsquo;t make it?&rsquo; I
asks him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may be able to make it, but you&rsquo;ll lose
money. Don&rsquo;t try it, Murky. Yuh ain&rsquo;t no packer
to begin with. It stands to reason that if O&rsquo;Connell
is afraid o&rsquo; it, it&rsquo;s no good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thanked him, but I stuck to the contract in spite
of what everybody said. I bought some pack-horses
an&rsquo; O&rsquo;Connell lent me five o&rsquo; his. My greatest
trouble was to find packers I could trust to keep
their mouths shut about the pass. You see, I
wanted to keep that a secret. It took me nearly two
weeks to get my crew together an&rsquo; load up the stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to deceive everybody,&rdquo; Murky resumed
after a short pause, &ldquo;we started out in broad daylight
over the regular trail leading to the Yellowhead.
They all jeered at us when we left Wandley&rsquo;s. Two
days out, we left the trail, circled back, an&rsquo; then one
dark night slipped down into the ravine an&rsquo; entered
the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>At this point, Sergeant Richardson interrupted
the narrator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom was the shipment consigned?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a free trader named Bentley,&rdquo; Nichols
promptly replied. &ldquo;He was jus&rsquo; opening up a new
tradin&rsquo; post in the Goose Lake country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Murky continued, &ldquo;we made a quick trip.
I was able to pay my packers almost double what
they generally got. Comin&rsquo; back, we took plenty
o&rsquo; time so as to make it appear that we had gone by
the Yellowhead route. But even at that, we was
weeks ahead o&rsquo; the schedule. O&rsquo;Connell nearly fell
out o&rsquo; his skin. He didn&rsquo;t know what to say an&rsquo;
neither did Wandley. O&rsquo;Connell offered me other
contracts an&rsquo; fer two years I made some easy money.
Then one day he comes to me, an&rsquo; by the look on
his face, I could see somethin&rsquo; was up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Murky,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
wrong about all this. I&rsquo;ve been watchin&rsquo; yuh.
Yuh ain&rsquo;t been takin&rsquo; none o&rsquo; the stuff through the
Yellowhead. What yuh been doin&rsquo; with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as that&rsquo;s any o&rsquo; your business,&rsquo; I
comes back. &lsquo;As long as the shipments reaches
their destination, yuh ain&rsquo;t got no kick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yuh&rsquo;ve found a shorter route,&rsquo; accused O&rsquo;Connell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what if I have?&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t fair to the shipper,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;Suppose
it leaks out that he&rsquo;s payin&rsquo; all this extra mileage.
What&rsquo;ll happen to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It don&rsquo;t never need to leak out,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But O&rsquo;Connell is hot-headed, an&rsquo; he informs me
that he&rsquo;s through. He goes away in a huff, an&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t see him again fer nearly a week. Then he
comes over an&rsquo; tries to make a dicker with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How much cash money will yuh take to show
me your route?&rsquo; he says, fingerin&rsquo; a roll o&rsquo; bills.
&lsquo;This thing has gone far enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t in the markey today,&rsquo; I told him a little
huffy. &lsquo;Yuh can do your own west coast packin&rsquo;
over any route that yuh like. I won&rsquo;t even listen to
yuh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He offered me fifteen hundred dollars but I refused.
Finally he goes away, an&rsquo; fer nearly a year
packs his own stuff through the Yellowhead, nursin&rsquo;
a sore spot in his chest. In a way, it was kind o&rsquo;
hard on me too. It had got so that I depended on
the money I received from him fer the work I did.
After a while, my capital dwindled down to jus&rsquo; a
few hundred dollars. I could see I had to go back
to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along about that time, a Nitchie breaks into the
warehouse at Fort Point o&rsquo; Call an&rsquo; steal a lot of
valuable fur. One o&rsquo; my packers heard it. The
thief was a friend o&rsquo; his. He had the stuff cached
up in the foothills but was afraid to move it for fear
he&rsquo;d get caught.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Murky ceased speaking and sat for several minutes
deep in thought. Then he turned upon Sergeant
Richardson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh see, I was gettin&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; desperate, sergeant.
This was a big temptation. My money was runnin&rsquo;
low. I thought it over fer a long time an&rsquo; finally
made a dicker with the thief. I agreed to take the
fur off his hands an&rsquo; dispose of it, gettin&rsquo; one-third
o&rsquo; the money fer my trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have no difficulty at all takin&rsquo; the fur
through the pass, an&rsquo; less than three weeks later I
had the money it brought safe in my pocket. The
man what bought the fur was a free trader who had
been in on some shady deals before, an&rsquo; I knew he&rsquo;d
keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the money sort o&rsquo; turned my head. It
was all so easy an&rsquo; simple, that I encouraged the half-breed
to try his luck again. The second time we was
successful. Then I went into the business wholesale.
I got my packers to steal too. Ever&rsquo; man I
hired was a crook. I needed a good confederate so
I made a proposition to La Qua an&rsquo; he accepted it.
Pretty soon I had agents all over the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business grew like a snowball rollin&rsquo; down
hill. It seemed like I couldn&rsquo;t stop it. I laid my
plans so well, it was pretty hard fer yuh fellows to
catch me. I made friends with Hart an&rsquo; O&rsquo;Connell
again, agreein&rsquo; to take out their shipments at a reduced
rate. When they accepted my offer, they
didn&rsquo;t know I was usin&rsquo; them as a sort o&rsquo; screen to
hide my real work&mdash;to keep yuh mounties guessin&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the last two years I&rsquo;ve made close to two hundred
thousand dollars. I was takin&rsquo; out stolen fur
on such a big scale that it didn&rsquo;t seem wise to sell to
the free traders any longer. It was too dangerous.
So I went to Seattle an&rsquo; made arrangements with
Captain Reynolds to come up here with his yacht
several times durin&rsquo; the year. I built the wharf an&rsquo;
warehouse. I think ever&rsquo;thing would be all right
today if&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; encouraged the policeman. &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been fer Daddy McInness,&rdquo; Nichols
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; Corporal Rand cut
in. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been suspicious of you for a long time,
Murky. The death of Daddy Mclnness merely
brought matters to a head. Murder is a terrible
thing, Nichols.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of the word, the prospector went suddenly
deathly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kill him!&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;Before God, I
tell yuh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence ended in a groan. Murky turned his
head guiltily and looked into the slowly dying fire.
For a long time he sat, eyes fixed sombrely on the
darkening mass. It was symbolic of his own case&mdash;charred
hopes and the ashes of defeat, where once
had burned brightly the consuming flames of avarice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">BACK AT FORT GOOD FAITH</span></h2>
<p>Months later, at Fort Good Faith, Dick and
Sandy sat in the trading room engaged in a game of
cribbage, when Factor MacClaren strode over to
their table, carrying in one hand a month&rsquo;s old copy
of an Edmonton newspaper. He interrupted the
game by spreading out the paper between them, and
turning the pages until he came to the particular item
he had just read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you boys would be interested,&rdquo; he said,
indicating the place at the bottom of the column.
&ldquo;Yesterday when the mail came in, I looked over this
copy of the Bulletin, but missed it somehow. Read
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Dick,&rdquo; commanded Sandy, &ldquo;read it
aloud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Dick picked up the somewhat crumpled sheet and
commenced breathlessly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Seattle, Washington, Dec. 3.&mdash;When the
yacht, Elenore, put into harbor this morning at
eight o&rsquo;clock, she was met at the wharf by Revenue
Officer Charles M. Steele and Corporal
Dickinson, the latter a member of the Canadian
Royal Northwest Mounted Police, with papers
for the arrest and detention of the crew. The
captain of the vessel, Silas Reynolds, and one
sailor were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is alleged that the Elenore has been engaged
in running contraband and stolen fur
from various Canadian points to this port. It
is understood that Captain Reynolds is under
arrest in British Columbia.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The long arm of the law,&rdquo; commented Sandy, as
he glanced over Dick&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I suppose it
would have been just the same if they had steamed
into Rangoon. In the end, they always get caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Murky did,&rdquo; added Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just like Murky. You can&rsquo;t fool the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially the Canadian Royal Mounted,&rdquo; appended
the other proudly.</p>
<p>In truth, Dick had every reason to be proud. In
the inside pocket of his coat there reposed the most
priceless of all his possessions&mdash;a letter from the
commissioner at Ottawa.</p>
<p>His application had been approved. Next spring
he and Toma would report to the adjutant at the
mounted police training barracks at Regina!</p>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
